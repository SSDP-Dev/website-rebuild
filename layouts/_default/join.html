  <h1>Join the student movement to end drug prohibition</h1>
  <p>A Student for Sensible Drug Policy is a student working toward ending the War on Drugs, and&nbsp; receives training, guidance, materials, and support from SSDP’s <a title="SSDP Staff" href="/staff" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">professional outreach staff</a>    based in Washington, DC. Becoming an SSDPer takes a little work, but it isn’t prohibitively difficult or time-intensive. Unlike most chapter-based student organizations, <strong>we do not charge our chapters any dues or fees</strong>. We also have
    tons of free (and some close-to-free) useful <a title="SSDP Resources" href="/movement" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">resources</a> to help you build your chapter, spread the word, lobby for key issues, and actually change drug laws, at
    the local, state, and federal levels (<a title="Campaigns" href="/campaigns/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">see our active campaigns here</a>).</p>

  <p class="boc_list_item_text normal">The steps below outline the typical process of starting an SSDP chapter. Every school, chapter, and chapter leader is different, so take this more as a general guide than hard requirements. Stay in touch with your<a href="/staff" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Movement Building Fellow</a>&nbsp;as
    you go through the steps and keep us up to date on your progress so we can help with any snags that may come up along the way. We’re here to be a resource for you!</p>
