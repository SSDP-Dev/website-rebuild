  <h2>Ismail Ali ‘16 | UC Berkeley School of Law</h2> From 2015-16, Ismail served as co-lead of Berkeley Law’s chapter of Students for Sensible Drug Policy, where he coordinated events that helped educate the law school community about entheogens, challenge the stigma associated with psychedelic drug
  use, and critique the racial dynamics of the emerging cannabis industry in California. Ismail earned his J.D. at the University of California, Berkeley School of Law in 2016, after receiving his Bachelor’s in Philosophy from California State University,
  Fresno, in 2012. As a law student, among leading and participating in other extracurricular activities which focused primarily on human rights, civil liberties, and racial justice, he also worked for the ACLU of Northern California’s Criminal Justice
  and Drug Policy Project. As Policy Fellow, Ismail supports MAPS’ legal and policy goals, including organizing the MAPS Psychedelic Legal Network, coordinating research in Latin America, and developing and implementing advocacy strategies. To support
  his work at MAPS, Ismail received Berkeley Law’s Public Interest Fellowship, a fellowship which provides funding for qualified Berkeley Law graduates who pursue legal work in the public interest. Ismail believes that psychedelic consciousness is a crucial
  piece of challenging oppression in all of its forms, and that legal access to psychedelics is an essential part of a progressive drug policy paradigm. He hopes to help develop and advocate for just, equitable, and creative alternatives to the failed
  war on drugs.

  <h2>Richard Hartnell ‘16| University of California, Santa Cruz</h2> Richard Hartnell once got expelled from his hometown community college for earning too many credits. Subsequently, he joined a circus collective in Oakland and spent the next half decade touring the US and EU. Subsequently, he earned a full scholarship
  from the University of California, Santa Cruz, where he majored with honors in cognitive science and neuroscience in order to satisfy an ensuing curiosity about the intersection of entheogens and creativity. Richard began with SSDP as the new founder
  of a dormant chapter at UC Santa Cruz. During his short stint directing the chapter, he brought the new group into a status as one of the most active chapters in the organization, earning two nominations in the first year for Rising Star Chapter and
  Rising Star Activist and another nomination for Outstanding Chapter the year following. The chapter has found success in their high-profile, high-impact harm reduction campaigns; in their first year, UCSC prevented hundreds of doses of fake MDMA from
  going out to the student body and reduced drug-related 911 calls at the campus's annual 4/20 party by 90%. Personally, RIchard keeps up his commitments as a psychedelic advocate by volunteering as a psychedelic crisis counselor, working to re-integrate
  psychedelics as a promising avenue in psychology research, and making psychedelic art.</div>

  <h2>Leslie Templeton ’16 | Boston College</h2> Leslie is the current chapter leader for her SSDP chapter at Boston College, where she studies psychology. Leslie has multiple disabilities, including learning disabilities, mental illness, and epilepsy. As special education student, Leslie’s activism
  started in disability rights in high school. She realized that those with disabilities were not given a voice or empowered, and often were afterthoughts and thought of as less-than their nondisabled peers. With this, Leslie strove to empower young disabled
  voices. She currently serves as an Administrator for the Women’s March on Washington Disability Caucus, where she stresses inclusivity of all marginalized disabled voices. With her chapter, Leslie has made it a priority to create harm reduction resources
  for her community, ensuring accessibility. She focuses on how the War on Drugs has affected disabled people, especially those of color; medicinal uses of stigmatized drugs; how prescription limitations affect those with disabilities; the inaccessibility
  of harm reduction and drug policy spaces; making accessibility a prerogative instead of an afterthought; drug use and disability; and disability rights. Leslie believes that drug policy is an important part of disability activism and vice versa. Her
  priority on the board is to raise awareness of all marginalized populations and how the War on Drugs affects them, giving them more of a voice within the organization.</div>
