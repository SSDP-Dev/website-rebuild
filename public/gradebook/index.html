<h4 id="introduction"><strong>Introduction</strong></h4>

<p>Students for Sensible Drug Policy
advocates for campus policies which center student health, safety, and
education rather than punitive enforcement of laws and campus
regulations which deny students access to education and needlessly
expose young to the dangers of the carceral system, law enforcement
practices such as the use of confidential informants, and overdose.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Every weekend across the U.S., 21
million college students make choices about how they are going to party.
Will it be a sober night, or will they choose to consume alcohol or
another drug of unknown origin, potency, or composition regardless of
rules or prohibitions against doing so? Based on government data about
drug use, we can conservatively estimate that, each month, 12 million
students choose to consume alcohol, 4 million choose to use marijuana,
and another 4 million will choose another drug.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Colleges and universities are obligated to protect the lives of students <em>in loco parentis</em>
 and must acknowledge the plain fact that students will use — and
sometimes misuse — drugs and alcohol despite decades of efforts to
eliminate such behaviors. Drug policies based in harm reduction ensure
the millions of students who will inevitably choose to use alcohol or
other drugs have a better chance of safely making it to graduation.</p>

<p>Throughout the nation, colleges have
been embracing practices that focus on safeguarding, rather than
punishing, students who abuse alcohol or illicit drugs, often at the
suggestion of students themselves. Such institutions stress that their
intent is not to be permissive, and that their rules against underage
drinking and illicit-drug possession remain in effect. Nevertheless,
faced with the persistent risk of alcohol-related student deaths, a
national upsurge in opioid overdoses, and nationwide spates of medical
emergencies among consumers of “club drugs,” the colleges have been
showing a willingness to suspend enforcement of their rules if necessary
 to keep students from being harmed.  – Schmidt, Peter (2016, September
13). Colleges Embrace Streetwise Tactics to Prevent Substance-Abuse
Deaths. <em>The Chronicle of Higher Education</em>. <a href="http://www.chronicle.com/article/Colleges-Embrace-Streetwise/237763">http://www.chronicle.com/article/Colleges-Embrace-Streetwise/237763</a></p>

<p>Students for Sensible Drug Policy publishes the Campus Drug Policy
Gradebook as a resource for students, administrators, and other members
of campus communities who seek to ground their approach to drugs in
health, safety, and education.</p>

<h4 id="campus-policy-grading-criteria"><strong>Campus Policy Grading Criteria</strong></h4>

<h5 id="medical-amnesty-policies-35-points">Medical Amnesty Policies (35 points)</h5>

<p>A full medical amnesty policy is
defined as an explicitly stated and publicized policy which protects
victims,callers, and bystanders in alcohol and drug related emergencies
from legal or school sanctions. Medical amnesty policies save lives by
removing the fear of calling for help during alcohol or other drug
related emergencies, greatly increasing the likelihood that such an
event is survivable and, in the case of ongoing substance misuse, a
student will participate in counseling and thereby reduce the risk of
additional events.</p>

<h6 id="ferpa-and-parental-notification"><em>FERPA and parental notification</em></h6>

<p>Under the <a href="http://www2.ed.gov/policy/gen/guid/fpco/ferpa/students.html">Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act</a>
 (FERPA), schools are permitted to contact a student’s parents or
guardians without the student’s consent when he or she has violated laws
 or institutional policies regarding the use of alcohol or drugs. As
such, even if  “parental notification” is not a listed sanction for a
particular school, such notification is still possible. We acknowledge
parents or guardians can provide an important support for students
struggling with alcohol or other drugs. However, parental notification
assumes parents are equipped to handle a complex health problem, the
student-parent relationship is characterized by healthy communication,
and the relationship with the parent or guardian is not a contributing
factor to drug misuse. Additionally, such laws violate the privacy of
legal adults, undermine the relationship of trust between students and
their school, and discourage students from seeking help from campus
health resources.</p>

<h5 id="drug-education-and-information-20-points">Drug Education and Information (20 points)</h5>

<p>The most effective drug education is
evidence-based, founded in the principles of harm reduction, readily
available via multiple delivery channels, and delivered by peers. SSDP’s
 <a href="http://ssdp.org/justsayknow">Just Say Know</a> peer-to-peer drug education meets these criteria and is available on campuses nationwide.</p>

<h5 id="naloxone-access-on-campus-10-points">Naloxone access on campus (10 points)</h5>

<p>The opioid overdose reversal drug
Naloxone should be available from the student health center and carried
by resident advisors and campus safety officers.</p>

<h5 id="sanctions-for-use-or-possession-of-alcohol-and-other-drugs-15-points">Sanctions for use or possession of alcohol and other drugs (15 points)</h5>

<p>Academic, legal, or financial
sanctions for use or possession of drugs do not reduce drug use, and
particularly do not reduce problematic drug use. Instead, they isolate
and stigmatize drug users and impede their ability to succeed. Ideal
policies are built on supportive, stabilizing strategies such as
evidence-based counseling and do not, in the absence of other dangerous
behavior, contain the types of sanctions historically relied upon by
institutions such as eviction, suspension or expulsion, forced
treatment, or mandatory fines which could lead to such sanctions.</p>

<h5 id="resident-advisor-discretion-10-points">Resident advisor discretion (10 points)</h5>

<p>Resident advisors should be trained
to recognize the signs of problematic drug use and responsible for
providing support in such cases but should be permitted discretion in
all others. They should not be permitted to engage in violations of
privacy such as bag searches.</p>

<h5 id="additional-criteria">Additional criteria</h5>

<ul>
<li>5 points: The student government is able to pass resolutions changing or requesting changes to campus policy</li>
<li>4 points: The campus offers a complimentary safe rides program</li>
<li>1 point: The campus does not have an absolute smoking ban</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="a-note-on-federal-funding-compliance-with-law-and-drug-policies"><strong>A note on federal funding, compliance with law, and drug policies</strong></h4>

<p>It is <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/122xDxUE2mtvuyaj3NQH9clqbP5kbRfaKx7A6cFQBg1w/edit?usp=sharing">commonly believed</a>
 that colleges and universities must maintain and enforce punitive drug
and alcohol policies to maintain funding.  In order to receive federal
funding and comply with the Higher Education Act, schools are required
to state their policies regarding drugs and alcohol. Many colleges also
list the possible legal penalties for alcohol and drug violations. As
these statements are required to receive funding, the statements are not
 interpreted to be relevant to the relative stringency of campus drug
and alcohol policies.</p>
