### **SSDP’s Diversity Awareness Reflection and Education (DARE) Committee**

SSDP DARE, formerly known as ORD
(Outreach Recruitment Diversity) Committee is a collaborative committee
comprised of board & non-board members, students, alumni, &
community members dedicated to broadening Students for Sensible Drug
Policy’s (SSDP) base & increasing engagement with presently
underrepresented perspectives.

Since its founding in March 2011,
DARE has taken on the challenges of strengthening diversity in all its
forms within SSDP. The committee endeavors to ensure that the range of
perspectives & personal experiences of all communities and
individuals negatively impacted in the War on Drugs are represented
& integrated into SSDP & the drug policy reform movement at
large. DARE does this by creating a welcoming, open, & safe space
for all stakeholders.

**How can I get involved?**

Members of our student-led board of
directors and a staff coordinator head the DARE committee, but all
students and alumni of SSDP are welcome to get involved. SSDP DARE meets
 by conference call on the first Tuesday of every month at 8pm EST.
 Join our [Google Group](https://groups.google.com/a/ssdp.org/forum/?hl=en#!forum/dare) or email our staff coordinator, Elise ([elise@ssdp.org](mailto:elise@ssdp.org)),
 to receive updates, share and discuss relevant news, plan the SSDP
Mosaics, and connect with a network of students and alumni concerned
with how the War on Drugs affects different communities.
