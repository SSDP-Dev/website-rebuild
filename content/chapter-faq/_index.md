# Frequently Asked Questions
  
## Do I have to pay dues to SSDP International?

Anybody is able to join SSDP, regardless of the amount of money you have to spend. Your commitment to drug policy reform is payment enough.

## If I join SSDP, will I have to follow orders from somebody in Washington D.C.?

SSDP has always been a grassroots organization that values the autonomy of its chapters. SSDP does have a national office in D.C., but its sole purpose is to serve the chapters. Though we may encourage you to work with us on national campaigns, we want you to work on what’s important to you. So – in short – no, you won’t be receiving orders from the national office.

## Cool. So I can do whatever I want as an SSDPer?

Almost, but not quite. Being part of an international organization requires a commitment to the [mission and values](/mission) of that organization. For example, since the organization “neither encourages nor condemns drug use,” encouraging people to smoke marijuana is not OK. However, encouraging people to change marijuana laws is more than OK. As a rule, SSDP activity is focused on drug policy, and *not* on using drugs.

## OK. Drug policy. Got it. So what’s next?

Start organizing! Our [resources page](/resources) has plenty of materials to get you started, and our [staff](/staff) are available to guide you through the process of starting a chapter.
