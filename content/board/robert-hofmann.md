<h2>Robert Hofmann â€˜16 | State University of New York - New Paltz</h2> Robert Hofmann joined the drug policy reform movement in 2016 after seeing the successes of marijuana legalization in Colorado and Washington. Rob has since participated in lobbying efforts to expunge the records of individuals with stop-and-frisk
possession arrests, Ban the Box, fully fund higher education, and legalize adult use marijuana in New York State. As President of the SUNY New Paltz chapter, Robert organized Know Your Rights trainings, policy discussions, and guided students in developing
their own substance education presentations. Rob is currently working as a campaign field organizer in Rhode Island and serves as the Chair of the Issues and Resources Committee. </div>
