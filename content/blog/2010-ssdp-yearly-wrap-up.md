This was an amazing year for <a href="http://ssdp.org/">Students for Sensible Drug Policy</a>!

We helped bring the issue of marijuana legalization into the national spotlight by launching the <a href="http://daregeneration.blogspot.com/2010/08/just-say-now.html" target="_blank">Just Say Now</a> campaign, a project with our friends at Firedoglake, that provided important tools like a free online phone banking system for activists around the country to call voters in four states with marijuana reforms on the ballot.

Our <a href="http://ssdp.org/chapters" target="_blank">chapter network</a> continues to expand throughout the U.S. and with the addition of an international liaison, SSDP is now rapidly expanding outside of the states and into key places like Mexico City. And for the first time, we hosted our international conference on the west coast and with over 500 people, it was our largest conference to date! Now that 2010 is behind us, we&#8217;re looking forward to 2011.<strong>
