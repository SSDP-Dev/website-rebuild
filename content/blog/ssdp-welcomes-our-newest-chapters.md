It&#8217;s a very exciting week as an Outreach Director when I get to see the establishment of not one, not two, but three new SSDP chapters in our national chapter network. The national office is excited to announce the charters of campus chapters at Whittier Law School, Grinnell College, and Ursinus College! Read more about our latest additions below in detail.



<a href="http://ssdp.org/chapters/west-coast/california/whittier-law-school/"><strong>Whittier Law School:</strong></a> Hailing from Costa Mesa, California, the latest addition to our our <a href="http://ssdp.org/chapters/#law-schools">LSSDP</a> chapter network is Whittier Law School, headed by chapter leader, Shirin Buckman. Shirin has been working for the past few months to get recognized by the campus administration and she has finally been successful in her efforts. Congrats Shirin, we couldn&#8217;t be more excited to have you as part of our chapter network. If you are a member of Whittier Law School or another LSSDPer, please give a shout out to Shirin!



<a href="http://ssdp.org/chapters/midwest/iowa/grinnell-college/"><strong>Grinnell Colllege:</strong></a> Our latest, and only Iowa SSDP chapter, headed by Thomas Neil is Grinnell College SSDP. Thomas started Students Lobbying Against Prohibition (SLAP) several months ago, and has since turned it into a sustainable campus organization. He recently decided to to enter the national SSDP network in hopes of becoming a more successful campus organization with the help of SSDP&#8217;s training, resources, and national staff. The Grinnell College SSDP/SLAP chapter is up to big things in Iowa, so if you are in the area, or attending school at Grinnell, please look them up.



<a href="http://ssdp.org/chapters/northeast/pennsylvania/ursinus-college/"><strong>Ursinus College:</strong></a> After a semester of hard work, Christopher Lipsett finally was able to establish an SSDP cahpter at Ursinus College in Collegeville, Pennsylvania. He&#8217;s looking forward to educating the campus community about the harms of the drug war, host film screenings, and discuss the potential benefits of psychedelic research happening surrounding MDMA and PTSD. We&#8217;re excited to have another chapter in the Keystone State, and if you&#8217;re attending Ursinus, please reach out and join the chapter!
