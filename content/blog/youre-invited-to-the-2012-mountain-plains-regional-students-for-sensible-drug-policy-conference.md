We’ve just extended the early bird registration rate so be sure to <a title="Register" href="http://hq-salsa.democracyinaction.org/o/1259/p/salsa/template/common/public/generate?show&amp;object=template&amp;key=13114">register</a> before Monday, August 27th at 11:59pm MST to take advantage of the discounted rate.



As you probably know, Amendment 64, the historic <a href="http://www.regulatemarijuana.org/">Initiative to Regulate Marijuana Like Alcohol</a> will be on the ballot this November for Coloradans to vote on. The initiative will be a focal point of this year’s conference. Students will meet with and learn directly from the campaign organizers and Colorado marijuana industry leaders. Panels and workshops will include community organizing, Law Enforcement Against Prohibition, Amendment 64 bootcamp, canvassing for the campaign, and a roundtable discussion with Colorado chapter leaders on SSDP’s statewide grassroots strategy.



Panels will feature speakers from the Campaign to Regulate Marijuana Like Alcohol, Law Enforcement Against Prohibition, the Harm Reduction Action Center, and the Drug Policy Alliance.



Hope to see you in Boulder!
