Are you an artist who has a message to share about the harms of the Drug War? Do you feel strongly about how international drug control regimes affect youth all across the globe? Can you utilize your creative talents to draw a connection between drug policies and human rights? If you answered yes, then SSDP wants you to contribute to one of our largest actions ever this April.

In three short months, the United Nations General Assembly will meet in New York to discuss the world drug problem. On Monday, April 18, right after <strong><a href="http://ssdp.org/events/ssdp2016/">SSDP 2016</a></strong>, Students for Sensible Drug Policy plans to join our global allies in NYC to make our voices heard. The focal point of the day will be an art installation at a public park that will raise awareness about the failure of prohibitionist drug policies and call the public to action over the course of the week as the UNGASS proceeds. The event will feature artwork created by students and alumni of SSDP as well as local community members in New York City, and will also feature speakers and performance art.

SSDP is currently seeking proposals from students, alumni, and anyone who has been impacted by the War on Drugs to develop projects for this installation. The demonstration will provide artists with an opportunity to create or perform a piece of art which expresses the relationship between youth and the War on Drugs. Art has always been a powerful vehicle for raising consciousness and this demonstration aims to facilitate a community discussion about the failure of the current drug control system.

We are looking for artwork in a variety of media, from both groups and individuals: 2D visual art, sculpture, performance art, and video or new media. While there is room for interpretation, the artwork must draw the viewer’s attention to the gravity of the issues caused by punitive drug policies and should generally follow the same themes as the <a href="https://stoptheharm.org/issues">Stop the Harm campaign</a>.

<strong><a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/19o7tlDICYj_yXXNdbNm9wPE9DSYcZUs3iPLT2zrUeZI/viewform">To submit an idea for an art project, installation, or performance piece, please fill out this Google Form</a>. </strong>

Submissions will be accepted on a rolling basis. A member of the SSDP team will get back to you shortly after you submit your proposal. For questions, please contact Joe Thorogood at <a href="mailto:joseph.thorogood.13@ucl.ac.uk">joseph.thorogood.13@ucl.ac.uk</a>
