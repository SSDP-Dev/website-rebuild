Earlier today, <a href="http://www.politico.com/story/2013/12/frank-wolf-virginia-2014-election-101243.html" target="_blank">Politico broke the news</a> that US Representative Frank Wolf (R, VA) will not be seeking re-election in 2014. This news is very exciting for drug policy reformers, as Rep. Wolf is one of the few remaining members of Congress still suffering from Reefer Madness.



You may recall Rep. Wolf from his statements in opposition to medical marijuana reform efforts in May of 2012. Members of Congress offered an amendment to the Justice Department spending bill to block the DEA from raiding patients, doctors and medical marijuana dispensaries in medical marijuana states. The amendment was debated on May 9, 2012 in the U.S. House of Representatives. Unfortunately, despite many strong statements by members of Congress in support, the Amendment was defeated in a roll-call vote.



Eight members of Congress argued thoughtfully about the simple justice and constitutional logic of recognizing the validity of these state laws. But one member — only one member — stood up to defend the raids, U.S. Rep. Frank Wolf. Wolf, nearly hysterical, brought up almost every myth about marijuana. He even suggested that medical marijuana laws should be compared to laws that would allow sexual trafficking in children!



Students for Sensible Drug Policy, in the long, honorable tradition of world-wide student activism, <a href="http://ssdp.org/news/blog/ssdp-confronts-sole-congressional-voice-against-medical-marijuana/">went to his home turf of Leesburg, VA to call out Rep. Wolf to his constituents and to confront him at the Fourth of July parade as he was campaigning for re-election to a 17<sup>th</sup> term.</a>
