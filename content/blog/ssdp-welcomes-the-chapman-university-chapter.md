I’m thrilled to introduce our newest chapter to the SSDP family: <a title="SSDP Chapman" href="http://ssdp.org/chapters/pacific/california/chapman-university/" target="_blank">Chapman University </a>from California!. Chapter leader Ashleigh Dennis has been working to start a chapter at Chapman since June. I asked Ashleigh about what her chapter has accomplished so far and what her plans are for the future:
<br/>
<strong>How did you hear about SSDP?</strong>
I heard about SSDP when I was a senior in high school, while I was interning for Diane Goldstein from Law Enforcement Against prohibition (LEAP), she was a guest speaker for the chapter at USC and I was able to tag along with her and was introduced to the organization there.
<br/>
<strong>Why did you want to get involved/what made you decide to start a chapter?</strong>
I&#8217;ve witnessed first hand the effects of the War on Drugs and the current policies in place so I decided to start a chapter at Chapman because I&#8217;ve met people here with similar experiences and interests and I wanted us to be apart of an organization that works towards sensible drug policy.

<br/>

<strong>What has the reception been like on campus so far?</strong>
I&#8217;m surprised at how accepting and open the administration and overall campus has been. There hasn&#8217;t been anyone that has opposed the starting up of this chapter which is very encouraging.
<br/>
<strong>What are some of the things you have planned or want to plan for next semester?</strong>
I&#8217;m looking forward to planning speaker events open to the entire campus featuring people who&#8217;ve had experiences with the War on Drugs, screening documentaries, and getting out information to the campus and community about what we can be doing to making changes to drug policy.
<br/>
<strong>What is the most challenging part of your experience starting/running the chapter so far?</strong>
I think the most challenging part is going to be going through the administrative red tape for planning various events.
<br/>
<strong>What is the most rewarding part? What are you most excited about right now?</strong>
The most rewarding part is finding students on campus who are passionate about changing drug policy and being able to provide them with a place to work towards making those changes. I&#8217;m most excited our chapter&#8217;s fir​st few meetings and getting started on planning events. I&#8217;m also excited for recruiting new members next semester!
<br/>
<strong>What is your vision for Chapman SSDP? Where do you see your chapter in a year? In 4 or 5 years?</strong>
My vision for Chapman is for it to be a large chapter connected with other chapters in Southern California. In a year, I see the chapter preparing for the 2016 election and being an active presence and voice on campus to bring about drug reform in the coming years.  In 4 or 5 years I hope we will have expanded our chapter and will have had many collaborative events with other chapters and organizations!
