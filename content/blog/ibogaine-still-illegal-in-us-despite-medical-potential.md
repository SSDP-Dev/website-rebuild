Readers are probably familiar with <a href="http://the-libertarian.co.uk/lsd-still-excessively-restricted-despite-medical-potential/" target="_blank">LSD</a> and <a href="http://the-libertarian.co.uk/mdma/" target="_blank">MDMA</a> (ecstasy), and may have heard of recent research on their medical uses. A lesser-known psychedelic drug, though, also shows potential despite federal prohibition. Ibogaine, extracted from the root bark of the iboga plant, shows great promise in treating drug addiction.



<i>Tabernanthe iboga</i>, a tropical shrub, is native to the sub-Saharan African nations of Gabon, Cameroon, and the Republic of the Congo. Practitioners of a tribal religion called Bwiti, which is recognized as an official religion in Gabon, cultivate the plant for its root bark. As part of traditional <a href="http://www.ibogaine.desk.nl/fernandez.html" target="_blank">religious practice</a>, members of tribes such as the Mabongo and Mitsogo consume doses of iboga large enough to cause visions and prolonged introspection. This practice is used both as an initiation ritual and a method of healing.



Although <a href="http://ibogaine.desk.nl/bwiti1.html" target="_blank">iboga</a> was first formally studied in the 19<sup>th</sup> century, ibogaine’s effects on addiction were first noted by <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/02/17/us/17lotsof.html?_r=0" target="_blank">Howard Lotsof</a>, a heroin addict in New York City. In 1962 he took a single dose of the drug, the effects of which lasted several days. Afterwards, he found that despite not using heroin at all during that time, he was not suffering any withdrawal symptoms. He has been free of addiction since then. Lotsof became a major advocate for ibogaine in treating addiction, <a href="http://www.ibogaine.desk.nl/clin-perspectives.html" target="_blank">writing</a> and <a href="http://www.ibogaine.desk.nl/alperetal.html" target="_blank">co-writing</a> several published scientific papers and even persuading the National Institute on Drug Abuse to seriously investigate the drug. He even convinced the Food and Drug Administration to approve a clinical trial of the substance, although the trial was never completed.



Currently the US federal government classifies ibogaine as a Schedule I drug. This means it supposedly has no accepted medical use within the US, a high potential for abuse, and “a lack of accepted safety for use of the drug,” even “under medical supervision.”

&nbsp;



As with other Schedule I drugs, though, this classification is highly questionable. Ibogaine has never been popular as a recreational drug. Those treated with it often refer to unpleasant <a href="https://www.erowid.org/chemicals/ibogaine/ibogaine_basics.shtml" target="_blank">side effects</a>, such as intense nausea and vomiting, which do not make them want to repeat the experience. Instead, the <a href="http://encod.org/info/IMG/pdf/ALPER_LOTSOF_AND_KAPLAN_REPORT.pdf" target="_blank">majority</a> of people taking it do so in an attempt to treat drug addiction.



Current human research suggests that safe use is certainly possible. Dr. Debra Mash, Professor of Neurology at the University of Miami School of Medicine, led a trial of the substance with about 300 subjects. She <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=syztZcpj69U" target="_blank">confirms</a> that the drug blocks the effects of withdrawal from opiates and diminishes cravings. A 2004 <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=khhsboVsyrw" target="_blank">documentary</a>, Ibogaine: Rite of Passage, covers the substance’s traditional use as well as its use to treat otherwise intractable addictions. Former heroin addicts since Lotsof have similarly <a href="http://www.newscientist.com/article/mg21929313.900-mindaltering-drug-could-offer-life-free-of-heroin.html?page=1" target="_blank">testified</a> that a single dose of the substance caused a long-lasting shift in their mental state and was enough to end their addiction permanently, with no withdrawal symptoms.



Some <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8930373" target="_blank">research</a> with very high doses demonstrated brain damage in rats, but these were much higher than the doses used in human research. Rats given doses similar to those used on humans did not suffer such damage.



The <a href="http://www.maps.org/research/ibogaine/" target="_blank">Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies</a> has funded research on ibogaine in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1nKGqlhRlo#t=0m17s" target="_blank">New Zealand</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jptk6YLhY6w#t=1m18s" target="_blank">Mexico</a>. Unlike more well-known psychedelics, ibogaine has not been formally investigated as a treatment for any condition other than drug addiction. Also unlike classic hallucinogens, ibogaine and iboga have been blamed for several deaths, although these have been rare. The mortality rate among those treated is <a href="http://www.ibogaine.co.uk/info.htm" target="_blank">estimated</a> at 1 in 300.



Although illegal in the US and several European countries<a href="#notes"><sup>1</sup></a>, ibogaine is not restricted by the international treaties which prohibit the more widely-known illicit drugs. In the <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-17666589">UK</a>, along with countries such as Mexico and Canada, it is neither banned nor legally approved as a medicine. Dr. Anwar Jeewa, who works with the substance at a clinic in Chatsworth, <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-17666589" target="_blank">explains</a> that is not &#8220;a magic bullet,&#8221; but &#8220;has to be taken in the right setting and treatment has to be followed up with psychosocial care.&#8221;
