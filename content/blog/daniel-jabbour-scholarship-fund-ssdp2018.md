Daniel Jabbour ‘07, an SSDP all-star alumnus, passed away in April of 2014. To honor and remember him, SSDP created <a href="https://ssdp.nationbuilder.com/daniel_jabbour_memorial_scholarship">the Daniel Jabbour Scholarship Fund</a> to help send outstanding activists to SSDP conferences. This year, the scholarship committee will be selecting a few SSDPers to attend <a href="https://conference.ssdp.org/">SSDP2018: The Students for Sensible Drug Policy Conference and Lobby Day</a>.

<div id="attachment_32842" style="width: 614px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class=" wp-image-32842" src="https://ssdp.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/alumni-2011-with-daniel-jabbour.jpg" alt="" width="604" height="371" /><p class="wp-caption-text"><em>Daniel Jabbour &#8217;07 – third from left, with glasses and light colored shirt and tie – with fellow SSDP alumni during the 2011 SSDP Conference and Lobby Day.</em></p></div>

Daniel’s driving passions in drug policy reform, psychedelics, and harm reduction led him to found the <a href="http://www.meetup.com/psychedelics">San Francisco Psychedelic Society</a>. Much like SSDP, the Psychedelic Society created a safe space for people to discuss their experiences, expand their knowledge, and work to change the status quo. This scholarship will be awarded to someone who has exhibited their dedication to education and policy reform around psychedelics and/or harm reduction.

<span style="font-weight: 400;">However, in order to make the scholarship work, we need money! If you or anyone you know has been impacted by Daniel’s life, <strong>please consider donating to the scholarship </strong></span><strong><a href="https://ssdp.nationbuilder.com/daniel_jabbour_memorial_scholarship">through this link </a>in order to help keep his legacy going. </strong>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">SSDP students and alumni may apply for the Daniel Jabbour Memorial Scholarship through </span><a href="https://goo.gl/forms/VqhnZDf8VJwbdRPG2"><span style="font-weight: 400;">this online application</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The deadline to apply is February 9, 2018.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Daniel impacted the lives of many SSDP students and alumni by doing everything from helping them get to conferences, giving them a place to stay, and teaching them the impact one person can make. He was a friend, a mentor, and a brilliant activist. Daniel will be greatly missed, but his legacy will continue on.</span>
