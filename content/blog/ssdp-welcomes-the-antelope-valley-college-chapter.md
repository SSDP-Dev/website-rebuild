Iâ€™m excitedÂ to introduce Timothy Spears Jr., the chapter leader at Antelope Valley College! Read on to learn more about him and his vision for the future of SSDP:

<b>Why did you want to get involved with SSDP?</b>

I discovered SSDP through MAPS (Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies).
I wanted to join because changing the policies around psychedelic substances is something that can lead to their use in the medical field, and to the benefit of many people.

<b>What does a sensible drug policy mean to you?</b>

A sensible drug policy to me is one that does the least amount of damage as possible.
Our current criminal justice system in regards to all policies, looks to simply punish, and never to help the offender. A sensible drug policy will help those with addictions come to terms with the fact, and conquer it.
<b>What do you hope to accomplish this year?</b>

This year I hope to increase the membership of my chapter to at least 30 people. It is my goal to make my school&#8217;s chapter a prominent club on campus, as the issues discussed are very important.
<b>What challenges have you faced? How do you plan to overcome them?</b>

The biggest challenge I&#8217;ve faced is getting people to get involved. Many of us are often bogged down with our own jobs and responsibilities, and the reality of the situation is that drug policy is not an important thing to many citizens.
I plan to overcome this by explaining why it should be important. You can better and saves the lives of others with just your vote, if nothing else.

<b>What advice would you give to people who are thinking of getting involved with SSDP?</b>
Advice I would give to anyone thinking of joining SSDP is to do it. The group is full of opportunities, and you can help spread information that the whole world needs to know. It&#8217;s fulfilling work in all aspects, whether you are a chapter leader or a conference attendee. The community is wide and active and a wonderful thing to be a part of.

<b>A fun fact?</b>
Fun fact, I DJ in my free time and make music, check it out here https://soundcloud.com/thehouseofpeace ðŸ™‚

<b>Anything else you want to add?</b>

Peace and Love!
