<em>Written by AZ/NV Campus Coordinator Cameron Oberlin</em>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">2016 is going to be a huge, transformational year for SSDP and drug policy reform. This year, SSDP brought on three new Campus Coordinators to work on the ground in states that are most auspicious for landmark reforms. Campus Coordinators will be tasked with expanding the SSDP network in their respective states, in addition to engaging students in that network with statewide medical and recreational cannabis initiatives. We now have Campus Coordinators for Florida, Massachusetts, Arizona, and Nevada.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Ready to take on the challenges and excitement in Florida is Colin Fitzgibbon. Colin is a staunch advocate for harm reduction policies and worked with the United for Care campaign to legalize medical marijuana in Florida in 2014. A graduate of the University of Miami holding a B.A. in Anthropology, Colin first began his journey with SSDP in 2011. He is energized and excited for the road ahead!</span>

Austin Davis will spearhead SSDP on the ground in Massachusetts. Austin graduated from Miami University Ohio in 2014 with a bachelor’s degree in History and Russian, Eastern European, and Eurasian Studies. Prior to joining the SSDP team, Austin interned in the Colorado Governor’s Office of Marijuana Coordination. Austin fiercely advocates for comprehensive medical cannabis research, regulation and consumption. She is excited to bring her knowledge and skill set to SSDP!

I myself, Cameron Oberlin, will be taking the charge in Arizona and Nevada. I’ve been an SSDPer since co-founding the first chapter in Arizona at Chandler-Gilbert Community College in 2010 with my colleague Scott Cecil. After completing my associates degree in 2012, I transferred to Arizona State University where I founded another new chapter of SSDP. I was president of the chapter until I graduated in 2014 with a B.S. in Political Science. During my final semester, I interned in Congressman Raul Grijalva’s Washington office. SSDP and drug policy has been my passion since my first year as an undergraduate student, and I couldn’t be happier with this opportunity to serve the organization which has helped to shape the person I am today.

We’re honored to be part of the SSDP team during such a critical year for drug policy reform. With so much at stake, it matters now more than ever that our team is strong, passionate, and leading with optimism. Colin, Austin, and I are ready to contribute as much as we possibly can towards that end. It’s safe to say that we all feel a certain sense of unity and cohesion amongst ourselves and the rest of the SSDP staff. We would like to thank Betty, Stacia, Drew, and the rest of the outreach staff for the opportunity and making us feel so welcome. This is a new chapter for each of us and we’re looking forward to what’s in store.
