<span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><b><span style="font-family: Helvetica, Arial, Verdana, sans-serif;">Were you or your chapter nominated for an award?</span></b><span style="font-family: Helvetica, Arial, Verdana, sans-serif;"> If so, you should have received a special copy of the conference program. There were two versions of the program, to tell which one you have, flip open the back cover. If you see a page on the left titled “Congratulations to this year’s SSDP Award nominees” you have the special version. If you open the back cover and see the “Sponsors” page, you have the regular version. We want to make sure those who were nominated for an award receive a copy of the special version (since your name will be in it), so let us know if you were nominated for an award but do not yet have a copy of the appropriate conference program and we’ll mail it to you.</span></span>
