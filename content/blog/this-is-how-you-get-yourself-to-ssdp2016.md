<span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="http://ssdp.org/events/ssdp2016/">SSDP2016</a> is just two months away! That means now is the time to get all of your ducks in a row to make sure you’re able to attend. To make things easier, we’ve laid out the 3 most important steps that students should take right away:</span>

&nbsp;
<ol>
	<li><strong>Register</strong></li>
	<li><strong>Arrange travel</strong></li>
	<li><strong>Arrange lodging</strong></li>
</ol>
<b>Step 1: REGISTER</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’re using CAT points to register, let your Outreach Coordinator know how many registrations you would like to use points for. They’ll set you up with a special registration code to use to register <a href="http://ezevent.com/ssdp2016">here</a>.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’re not using CAT points to register, purchase your registration </span><a href="http://ezevent.com/ssdp2016"><span style="font-weight: 400;">here</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Prices go up after February 28th, so don’t miss your chance to get the lowest available rates!</span>

<b>Step 2: ARRANGE TRAVEL</b>

<a href="http://ssdp.org/events/ssdp2016/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Please see this page</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for more detailed information on when and where you should plan to arrive and depart.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Flight prices are typically lowest about 6-8 weeks out from your travel date. That window starts now and ends around March 4th. We recommend using <a href="https://www.kayak.com/">Kayak.com</a> and <a href="https://www.southwest.com/">Southwest.com</a> to find the lowest fares. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’re planning to drive, make a plan for when you will leave, who will drive, etc. You can use a trip calculator </span><a href="http://www.gasbuddy.com/TripCostCalculator"><span style="font-weight: 400;">like this one</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to estimate how much gas will cost. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’re interested in using CAT points for (up to half the cost of your) travel, please contact your Outreach Coordinator as soon as possible. </span>

<b>Step 3: ARRANGE LODGING</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’re planning to use CAT points to pay for conference lodging, let your Outreach Coordinator know as soon as possible. Check-in is on <strong>Friday, April 15th</strong> and check-out is the morning of <strong>Monday, April 18th</strong>. Conference registration begins at 5:00pm on Friday so you may want to plan on arriving earlier to get settled in. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’re not planning to use CAT points for lodging, you can </span><a href="http://www.holidayinn.com/redirect?path=hd&amp;brandCode=hi&amp;localeCode=en&amp;regionCode=1&amp;hotelCode=WASWP&amp;_PMID=99801505&amp;GPC=SD6"><span style="font-weight: 400;">book your room at the hotel using this link</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Or you may call (703) 807-2000 to make your reservation, just be sure to mention you’re with the SSDP conference (group code: “SD6”). Our group rate on hotel rooms is available 3 days before and after the conference, so you’re welcome to utilize our discounted rate as early as 4/12. Hotel rooms will likely sell out though so be sure to reserve yours as soon as you can.</span>

If you are planning on participating in SSDP&#8217;s UNGASS demonstration on Monday April 18th, we will be boarding buses early Monday morning to head for New York. We recommend staying overnight in New York on Monday and departing on Tuesday so you can enjoy the full day of activities in the city and not be rushed to get to the airport or train station. Information on lodging options in New York on the 18th is forthcoming. If you do need to depart Monday evening, the SSDP bus will be making stops at La Guardia Airport, JFK Airport, and back to Arlington, VA in the evening.
