<b>How do I apply for a scholarship?</b>

Fill out the form here: <a href="https://www.etouches.com/ereg/newreg.php?eventid=117810&amp;" target="_blank">https://www.etouches.com/ereg/newreg.php?eventid=117810&amp;
</a>

You will need a code to register. Please contact your chapter leader or your Outreach Coordinator for your code.

<strong><strong> </strong></strong>

<b>When is the deadline to apply?</b>

<del>Friday May 22, 2015</del>

Update: the deadline is now 11:59pm EST August 1, 2015.

<strong><strong> </strong></strong>

<b>Should I register first or apply for a scholarship first?</b>

SSDP students apply for a scholarship first. Scholarship decisions will be sent out the week of August 3. Once you receive your decision, then you should register with the special code we provide.

<strong><strong> </strong></strong>

<b>What types of scholarships are available?</b>

There are three categories of scholarship awards detailed below (Registration, Lodging, and Travel).

<strong><strong> </strong></strong>

<b>1) Registration: </b> Funds are sent to DPA in order to cover the discounted registration amount. Student registration (early bird) is $175. Since the $20 scholarship application fee will be applied toward this cost, $155 will still be due.  If a full registration scholarship is awarded, SSDP will allocate $XXX from our registration scholarship fund to DPA.

Ex:

$175 Total Student Registration Fee (early bird rate, before Sept. 6)

&#8211; $20    Scholarship Application Fee (paid by applicant, put toward total registration fee)

&#8211; $155 Full Registration Scholarship Award (paid by SSDP to DPA)

= $0 Remaining registration amount (paid by applicant)

<strong><strong> </strong></strong>

If a partial registration scholarship is awarded, SSDP will send the award amount, to DPA, and the recipient would still be responsible for the remaining amount.

Ex:

$175    Total Student Registration Fee (early bird rate, before Sept. 6)

&#8211; $20    Scholarship Application Fee (paid by applicant, put toward total registration fee)

&#8211; $50    Partial Registration Scholarship Award (paid by SSDP to DPA)

= $105   Remaining registration amount (paid by applicant)

<strong><strong> </strong></strong>

If no registration scholarship is awarded, the applicant will still be responsible for the remaining amount.

Ex:

$175    Total Student Registration Fee (early bird rate, before Sept. 6)

&#8211; $20    Scholarship Application Fee (paid by applicant, put toward total registration fee)

&#8211; $0    Registration Scholarship Award

= $155   Remaining registration amount (paid by applicant)

<strong><strong> </strong></strong>

<b>2) Lodging:</b> SSDP has been allotted a block of hotel rooms in the Crystal Gateway Marriott hotel. We will be updating this page with the specific dates covered by scholarship hotel rooms. Scholarship recipients will be assigned to these rooms by SSDP staff. There will be four scholarship recipients in each room, and we will do our best to honor roommate preferences. Non-scholarship recipients can not stay in these rooms.

<strong><strong> </strong></strong>

<b>3) Travel:</b> Funds are to help reimburse you for part of your travel costs (i.e., airfare, gas, ground transportation.) Travel scholarships are distributed via check. This check will be mailed to you after the conference or hand delivered to you by an SSDP staff member during the conference. Travel scholarships will not be disbursed in advance (i.e. SSDP will not book any flights for recipients). Typical travel scholarship award amounts range from $50-$200.

<strong><strong> </strong></strong>

<b>What does a typical scholarship cover?</b>

Scholarship packages are negotiated on an individual basis, so many recipients may receive a scholarship in one or two of these categories (i.e. Student A receives registration discount, but no travel reimbursement, and no lodging, Student B receives lodging space in a shared hotel room and registration discount, but no travel reimbursement, etc.). It is also possible for a recipient to receive a scholarship award package in all 3 categories (i.e. Student C receives registration discount, travel reimbursement, and lodging space in a shared hotel room), however this scenario is not typical.

<strong><strong> </strong></strong>

<b>Is there anything specific I should add to my application to make sure I am considered for a student scholarship?</b>
<ul>
	<li>Page 1: enter your email address, click the box for “regular applicant $20” and press “continue”</li>
	<li>Page 2: Make sure to click “yes” for “are you a student?”
<ul>
	<li>Once you click “yes,” another field will appear. Enter the name of your school in this field.</li>
	<li>For “If you are a student, are you a participating member of an active SSDP chapter at your school?*”, click “yes”</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<strong><strong> </strong></strong>

<b>What if I’m not a student?</b>

You are still eligible to apply for a scholarship, just make sure to mark “no” on the application where it asks if you are a current student. SSDP staff will not be evaluating non-student scholarship applications, these applicants will be reviewed by DPA staff.

<strong><strong> </strong></strong>

<b>I live outside of the United States, am I eligible to apply for a scholarship?</b>

Yes: make sure to check the bubble for “International Applicant” on Page 1 of the application. SSDP staff will not be evaluating international attendee scholarship applications, these applicants will be reviewed by DPA staff.

<strong><strong> </strong></strong>

<b>When will I hear back from someone?</b>

The SSDP staff will be evaluating scholarship applications and contacting applicants to determine scholarship awards after the application deadline (May 22). Scholarship decisions will be sent out the week of August 3. We will update this page with more precise dates as that information becomes available.

<strong><strong> </strong></strong>

<b>Why do I need to pay $20?</b>

All scholarship applicants are required to pay the $20 application fee. If you are awarded a scholarship, this amount will be put toward your registration fee. If you are not awarded a scholarship and decide not to attend the conference, unfortunately this is non-refundable.

<strong><strong> </strong></strong>

<b>How many people does the $20 cover?</b>

The $20 application fee only covers you.

<strong><strong> </strong></strong>

<b>What if I’m not involved in an active SSDP chapter?</b>

You are still eligible to apply through DPA’s general scholarship fund. Student applicants who are not currently involved in an active SSDP chapter will be reviewed by DPA staff.

<strong><strong> </strong></strong>

<b>Who will be reviewing my application?</b>

If you identify yourself as being currently involved with an active SSDP chapter in your application, it will be reviewed by SSDP staff. If you do not identify as an SSDPer, your application will be reviewed by DPA staff.
