We&#8217;re excited to announce the two newest additions to our <a href="http://ssdp.org/chapters">chapter network</a> this week. Welcome to the team, <a href="http://ssdp.org/chapters/midatlantic/district-of-columbia/gwulaw">GWU Law</a> and <a href="http://ssdp.org/chapters/northeast/massachusetts/wheaton">Wheaton</a> SSDP!

<a href="http://ssdp.org/chapters/midatlantic/district-of-columbia/gwulaw"><strong>The George Washington University Law School</strong></a> &#8211; <em>Washington, DC </em>(<a href="http://ssdp.org/chapters/midatlantic">Mid-Altantic Region</a>)

Kellen Ruscinello is currently pursuing his JD/MPH degrees as a 2nd year student at GWU Law. Since 2010, he has served as President of the GW Student Association for Drug Law Reform, which was re-chartered yesterday as GW Law Students for Sensible Drug Policy! The group has been hard at work this school year, they&#8217;ve held several events including yesterday&#8217;s panel entitled &#8220;Mexico: Violence, Corruption and Drugs: Social Issues and Reform in Mexico&#8221; with Maureen Meyer from the Washington Office on Latin America and Eric Sterling from the Criminal Justice Policy Foundation. GWLSSDP joins our network as our fifth law school chapter,<a href="http://ssdp.org/chapters/law"> see the full list here</a>.

In January, James Salamon heard about SSDP when his professor brought us up in his Mysticism and Spirituality course. After doing some of his own research and becoming more and more intrigued by the issue, he got in touch with the national staff to get the ball rolling. Earlier this week, Wheaton SSDP stood before their Student Government Association and received official student group recognition! As a group, they feel that their presence on campus can act as an educational tool to the college community and beyond.
