The holiday season is almost upon us, and now is the perfect time to make your holiday shopping count towards making the world a more sensible place! We have listed below two of the ways you can donate to SSDP simply by shopping for the things you buy anyway:

&nbsp;
<ul>
	<li><a href="http://igive.com">Sign up today at iGive.com</a> and an average of 3% of your purchases at participating stores will benefit SSDP. And, if you install the browser button when you sign up, we get an extra $5 though a limited-time promotion.</li>
	<li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/?_encoding=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;tag=studentsforse-20" target="_blank">Donate to SSDP by shopping at Amazon!</a><img style="border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;" src="https://ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=studentsforse-20&amp;l=ur2&amp;o=1 " alt="" width="1" height="1" border="0" /> &#8211; Just click the link and shop as you normally would. As long as you get to Amazon via our link, 4-6% of your purchase will go to SSDP. You must click this link every time you shop at Amazon for future purchases to count for SSDP. Make sure to bookmark this page. <em>The 4-6% comes from Amazon, and does not add anything to the price that you pay. You will not receive any sort of notification that your purchase counted towards SSDP. We do this through the Amazon Associates program.</em></li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li><a title="eBay Giving Works SSDP" href="http://donations.ebay.com/charity/charity.jsp?NP_ID=23613&amp;categoryId=11232" target="_blank">eBay Giving Works</a> &#8211; Want to sell something on eBay? List it as a giving item to SSDP, and a portion (set by you) of the proceeds from your auction will be donated to SSDP. <em>This donation is paid for by the seller, not eBay.</em></li>
</ul>
