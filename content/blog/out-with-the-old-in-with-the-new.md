Last weekend in Los Angeles at the International Drug Policy Reform Conference, nearly 100 SSDPers convened for this year&#8217;s annual Congress where we elected new student members to our board of directors.



A total of 16 people ran for the board this year, making it an extremely difficult race! Thank you, candidates and congress participants! Just a reminder- our next congress will take place at <a href="http://ssdp.org/conference">SSDP2012: our 13th Annual International Conference in Denver, CO March 24-25, 2012,</a> where we&#8217;ll be having another round of board elections.



I&#8217;d like to first send a huge thank you to outgoing student board members: Mischa Steiner, Kat Reardon, and Alex Woon. Working with you all has been such an amazing experience. Thank you for your countless hours of inspiration and dedication!
