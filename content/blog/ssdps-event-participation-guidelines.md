Students for Sensible Drug Policy recognizes that ending the War on Drugs rests on building an inclusive community dedicated to consciously addressing the disparate impacts of the War on Drugs and the ways in which its policies have marginalized specific, targeted people and communities, most particularly people and communities of color. We are committed to working with allies across ethnic, gender, national, religious, health, political, ideological, experiential, and all other spectrums of difference to co-create sensible drug policies which achieve safety and justice by recognizing that our liberty is bound together.

Therefore, Students for Sensible Drug Policy Foundation will only partner with, sponsor, or promote those events which honor the following principles:

<strong>Diversity. </strong>Steering committees, speakers, and others provided with a platform will be representative of impacted communities. Events with speaker slates which are entirely or predominantly male or white will be rejected. Events which provide a platform for speakers who are revealed to express racist, sexist, homophobic, or other marginalizing views will be rejected.

<strong>Social good. </strong>Business conferences or those oriented toward profit will include discussion or presence of social good business practices.

<strong>Scholarship or direct giving. </strong>For-profit conferences will have a give-back component. This could include scholarships for members of impacted communities or direct giving to a drug policy reform organization or an organization serving impacted communities.

We encourage all SSDP chapters to practice and adopt these values.
