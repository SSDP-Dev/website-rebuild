<span style="font-weight: 400;">Hello SSDPers!</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">My name is <a href="http://ssdp.org/about/staff/brian-ortiz/" target="_blank">Brian Ortiz</a> and I am SSDP’s 2016 California Campus Coordinator. My job is to act as an on-the-ground organizer, grow SSDPs presence on campuses, and facilitate collaboration between SSDP and marijuana reform ballot initiatives being voted on in the November 2016 election.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">In order to contribute to next year&#8217;s campaigns efficiently, it is critical that we immediately begin strengthening our existing chapters and nurturing new ones on strategic campuses. In this way, when 2016 arrives our California chapters will be on-call and ready to provide the volunteers and advocates necessary for voter registration, phone banking, and media outreach efforts.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">In other words, I am the go-to guy for chapters interested in deeply engaging with the 2016 campaigns. Together we will energize your members about the campaign and channel that interest into effective on-the-ground advocacy. I will be in touch with California chapters soon and you are always welcome to hit me up any time at </span><a href="mailto:brian@ssdp.org"><span style="font-weight: 400;">brian@ssdp.org</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> or (201) 486-0164.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Stay sensible!</span>
