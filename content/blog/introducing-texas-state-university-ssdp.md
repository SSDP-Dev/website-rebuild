It is with great fervor that I introduce Sharon Medina and the Texas State University (TSU) SSDP chapter, hailing from in San Marcos, TX. The formation of TSU SSDP marks our 4th official chapter of SSDP in Texas. Sharon has been a joy to work with since she first contacted me last March. Since then she and her chapter Vice President Justin Sukhan have done everything right, going from two friends interested in starting an SSDP chapter to a burgeoning chapter with over 100 supporters on campus as of the end of the fall 2016 semester.

<div id="attachment_20766" style="width: 170px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img class=" wp-image-20766" src="http://ssdp.org/assets/sharon-300x300.jpg" alt="TSU SSDP Chapter President Sharon Medina" width="160" height="155" /><p class="wp-caption-text">TSU SSDP Chapter President Sharon Medina</p></div>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The TSU SSDP chapter also has a somewhat unique flare for entrepreneurship and many of the chapter founders are also involved with the Hispanic Student Business Association on campus. In fact, Justin is in a leadership position with the Association and is a business owner himself, of a food truck in San Marcos. The chapter leadership has been able to leverage this entrepreneurial approach to reach a large number of students and engage them in a very exciting way: they have begun a very interesting conversation among the campus community about what the future of cannabis Â industry might look like in Texas and how young people and Hispanic business leaders can position themselves now to be a leader in tat industry.</span>

One other notable action this chapter has engaged in since its official inception a few months ago was to adopt a 5-mile stretch of highway outside of San Marcos for which they will be responsible for keeping free of litter. Once they complete six clean-ups in a 12-month period, the stretch of highway will be named after Texas State SSDP.

<span style="font-weight: 400;">This chapter thinks big and I expect big things from them in the coming months. Watch this space for further details and updates about their successes.</span>
