<span style="font-weight: 400;">As <a href="https://ssdp.org">Students for Sensible Drug Policy</a> wraps up our 2017-18 program year, I’d like to share a story with you about the power of student organizing.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Inspired by their experience at SSDP2018 Lobby Day and equipped with the training they received there, student leaders from SUNY Binghamton, SUNY Albany, and SUNY New Paltz organized their own New York State lobby day this past April. Students scheduled meetings with eight elected officials to voice their support for S3040 &amp; A3506 which, if passed, would tax and regulate cannabis for adult use in New York. Students also discussed A10195, an industrial hemp bill.  </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Grant Loew &#8217;16, chapter leader from SUNY Binghamton and lead organizer of this lobby day says, “While it can seem daunting to those who have never directly engaged their representatives, lobbying is for everyone. It&#8217;s paramount that people go out and make their voices heard, no matter their level of experience.” </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Your support helps Grant &#8212; and students like him in almost every state &#8212; speak truth to power and push for sensible marijuana policy reform. </span>

<a href="https://ssdp.org/donate"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Will you make a gift today to help students like Grant continue their work in the 2018-19 school year?</span></a>
