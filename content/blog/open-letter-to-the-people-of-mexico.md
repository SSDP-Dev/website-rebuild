<b>To the People of Mexico:</b>

We, Students for Sensible Drug Policy (SSDP), stand in solidarity with the people of Mexico affected by the escalation of narco-violence in recent years, as demonstrated most recently in Iguala with the murder and abduction of student protesters. We offer our condolences to all victims of the failed war on drugs, including those killed and/or kidnapped by cartels, the families of those individuals, and all those forced to live life in a perpetual state of fear caused by a combination of narco-violence and government corruption.

SSDP is a grassroots, student-led organization committed to ending the failed war on drugs at every level and working toward policies which respect human rights, focus on public health, and are based on scientific evidence instead of fear. As an organization composed of students dedicated to fighting social injustices and challenging social norms, the recent events in Iguala hit particularly close to home because we see bits and pieces of ourselves in each and every one of the students from the Raúl Isidro Burgos Rural Teachers College of Ayotzinapa.  SSDP recognizes that for over a century, poorly constructed U.S. drug policies have exacerbated drug-related problems in Mexico and as an organization we are actively working to reform the aforementioned policies.

Deeply troubled by the lack of action at the domestic and international levels, SSDP will stand in solidarity with the victims of the failed war on drugs until policies enacted by Mexico and the United States do not actively empower narco-violence.

&nbsp;

Sincerely,

<strong>Students for Sensible Drug Policy</strong>
