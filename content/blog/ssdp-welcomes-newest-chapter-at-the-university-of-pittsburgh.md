Matt Ashford, who is studying towards his Masters of Social Work, recently re-started the chapter and looks forward to shaking things up on campus.



He was recently inspired to start an SSDP chapter after having issues with the way Pennsylvania legislature addresses marijuana and alcohol policy within the commonwealth. Matt hopes to educate and inspire fellow students to get involved in the growing student movement against the drug war, and breakdown the more conservative approach to drug policies on and off campus.



If you are a student at Pitt, or another SSDP chapter leader in Pennsylvania, <a href="http://ssdp.org/chapters/northeast/pennsylvania/university-of-pittsburgh/">reach out</a> to Matt today. SSDP is very excited to have the Pitt SSDP chapter back up and running!
