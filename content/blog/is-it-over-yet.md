The DEA has continued to raid medical marijuana dispensaries in California since President Obama took office. We know Obama has stated the he does not support using justice department resources to undermine state law on this issue. Yet the DEA continues to waste these resources on law abiding, tax paying dispensaries.

There is light at the end of the tunnel. Actually, its more like already having half your body out of the tunnel while DEA agents are wasting your own tax dollars to pull you back in.

Yesterday, the White House issued a <a href="http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2009/feb/05/dea-led-by-bush-continues-pot-raids/">statement</a> explaining that we can expect these raids to end once President Obama nominates a new DEA Administrator.
<blockquote>“The president believes that federal resources should not be used to circumvent state laws, and as he continues to appoint senior leadership to fill out the ranks of the federal government, he expects them to review their policies with that in mind,&#8221; White House spokesman Nick Shapiro said.</blockquote>
This is a victory not just for California, but for 12 other states that have passed medical marijuana legislation.

The answer to my question is no, its not over yet. Stay persistent and continue writing letters to the editor and contacting your representatives. Be sure to sign and spread the word about our <a href="http://www.ssdp.org/stoptheraids">petition</a> to stop the raids!
