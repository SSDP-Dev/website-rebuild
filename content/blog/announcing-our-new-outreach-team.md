I&#8217;m so excited to announce our newest staff members and also to announce a promotion for one staffer who&#8217;s been with us for several years.  As we say goodbye to one <a href="http://ssdp.org/news/blog/goodbye-to-a-genuine-rock-star-ssdp-staffer">rock star staffer</a>, we welcome three new regional outreach coordinators who will serve our chapter network by providing the support our students need to establish and sustain active and robust SSDP chapters.



I&#8217;m excited to announce that Stacia Cosner, who has served in various outreach capacities at SSDP since 2009, will be now be managing our US outreach department as Associate Director of SSDP.  This promotion reflects Stacia&#8217;s growth as a leader and mentor to our students.



Now, meet our new coordinators:

<blockquote>

<h4>Jason Ortiz &#8211; Regional Outreach Coordinator

Northeast and Mountain Plains regions</h4>

<img class="alignleft" title="Jason Ortiz" src="http://ssdp.org/assets/images/staff/natl/ortiz-profile-pic.jpg" alt="" width="90" height="93" />Formerly a member of our national board of directors, Jason brings years of organizing experience through his various activist endeavors on campus at the University of Connecticut as well as in the larger community.  He received the &#8220;Change Beyond Campus&#8221; award at our conference earlier this year for his extraordinary work running as an Independent candidate for Connecticut state representative.



&nbsp;

<h4>Drew Stromberg &#8211; Regional Outreach Coordinator

Mid-Atlantic and Southern regions</h4>

<img class="alignleft" title="Drew Stromberg" src="http://ssdp.org/assets/images/staff/natl/drew.jpg" alt="" width="90" height="96" />Along with other WVU chapter leaders, Drew has helped bring the drug policy reform conversation to the state of West Virginia.  In addition to engaging in a variety of campaigns and events in Morgantown, WV, Drew and his chapter have worked hard to find creative ways to utilize web tools to organize students and create change.  To recognize the chapter&#8217;s outstanding web presence, we were happy to award the &#8220;Morgan Lesko Online Organizing&#8221; award to the chapter earlier this year under Drew&#8217;s leadership.



&nbsp;

<h4>Devon Tackels &#8211; Regional Outreach Coordinator

West Coast and Midwest regions</h4>

<img class="alignleft" title="Devon Tackels" src="http://ssdp.org/assets/images/staff/natl/devon-capitol-for-bio.jpg" alt="" width="90" height="64" />When we gave Devon the &#8220;Rising Star&#8221; award at our 2010 conference, we knew he was one to watch.  Since getting involved in 2008, Devon has played a critical role in founding and running one of our largest and most active chapters in the country at Virginia Commonwealth University.   He has also pioneered a working relationship between the VCU chapter and VCU administrators, faculty, and staff through working with the campus wellness center to plan and implement &#8220;Just Say Know&#8221;, an evidence-based drug education program. Under Devon&#8217;s leadership, the chapter received the &#8220;Outstanding Chapter&#8221; award at this year&#8217;s conference.</blockquote>

Chapter leaders should feel free to reach out and introduce themselves to their new regional staff member.  They&#8217;ll be getting in touch with everyone individually in the coming weeks as well.



Congratulations and welcome to the team, Stacia, Jason, Drew and Devon!
