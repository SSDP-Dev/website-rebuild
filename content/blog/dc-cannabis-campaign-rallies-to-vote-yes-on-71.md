DC’s marijuana advocacy group <a href="http://dcmj.org/">DCMJ</a> is currently collecting signatures for their campaign to change outdated marijuana laws in Washington DC. The group aims to legalize the possession of marijuana and marijuana plants in limited amounts for people 21 and older.

On April 15th the DC Board of Elections and Ethics finalized Ballot Initiative #71, naming it “Legalization of Possession of Minimal Amounts of Marijuana for Personal Use Act of 2014”. This initiative would make it legal for anyone 21 and older to possess of up to two ounces of marijuana for personal use, and to transfer (without payment) up to one ounce to another person 21 and older. Initiative #71 also allows cannabis paraphernalia to be sold or used, and allows adults 21 and older to grow up to six cannabis plants, no more than three of which can be mature, within the person’s principal residence.

The Campaign has until the first week of July to collect  22,000 valid signatures in order to put initiative #71 on the ballot in November’s General Election. On June 1st they held a signature-gathering blitz throughout Washington, DC and just recently collected signatures at last week’s Pride Parade and Festival.

Feedback on the initiative varies; while some support #71 in its entirety, others have concerns about the language and logistics. For example, one DC resident is concerned “[the number of] plants should be limited to residence rather than the person. If 5 people live in a group home, if they all get to grow 6 plants, you got 30 plants.”

DCMJ is aiming to collect a total of 70,000 signatures in the next three weeks, and they are currently hiring paid signature gatherers to help meet this goal. More information on the petition and how to apply to be a paid signature gatherer can be found here: <a title="DCMJ" href="http://dcmj.org/jobs/" target="_blank">http://dcmj.org/jobs/</a>
