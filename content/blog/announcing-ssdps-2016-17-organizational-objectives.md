Each year, the Students for Sensible Drug Policy board, staff, and select students and alumni come together for an in-person “Strategy Summit.” A couple of weeks ago, we gathered in Berkeley, CA to discuss the activities and direction of the organization and came to conclusions on our plan for the upcoming year. This plan is finalized as our <a href="http://ssdp.org/about/strategy/">2016-2017 SSDP Organizational Objectives</a>, which guide our work throughout the year and hold the staff and board accountable to SSDP&#8217;s 4,000+ student members. We&#8217;re proud to share this year&#8217;s objectives with you.
<div id="attachment_19146" class="thumbnail wp-caption aligncenter">
<h4 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #136f8d;">Movement Building</span></h4>
</div>
<span style="color: #ffa732;"><b>Strengthening the network.</b></span>

We will expand our network with active presence on 400 campuses during the year — including 2/3 established <a href="http://ssdp.org/chapters">chapters</a> at any given time — with 3,500 active members.

We will continue to develop and grow the SSDP <a href="http://ssdp.org/alumni">Alumni Association</a> program, more strongly connecting students to Alumni members through the mentorship program, keeping Alumni engaged as advocates, and developing Alumni as philanthropists. Membership will grow to more than 230 members.

Our Campus Campaign program will strategically leverage drug policy initiatives between January and December 2016 in targeted states, leading to a 100% increase in the number of active campuses, 800% increase in the number of students we communicate with, and 300% increase in number of chapter members &amp; Ambassadors.

We will provide meaningful resources and support to our international chapter network and seek out opportunities to empower international SSDP chapters within the SSDP network.

We — staff and members — will collaborate with allies from across the political spectrum and non-drug policy reform groups to spread our message of reform.

We will actively engage our stakeholders through regular, meaningful, and carefully curated <a href="http://ssdp.org/mailing-list-sign-up/">contact</a>.

We will seize compelling opportunities to address external audiences concerning drug policy reform and to engage in public debates.

<span style="color: #ffa732;"><strong>Bringing people together.</strong></span>

Our staff will utilize professional best practices in <a href="http://ssdp.org/events">event</a> planning, execution, and evaluation.

We will work with local chapters and Alumni Association members to host regional conferences, attended by an average of 75 participants, in 6 locations during the Fall 2016 semester.

We will facilitate, in collaboration with allies, training opportunities to further legislative reform in at least six states.

We will successfully execute the SSDP2017 Conference in Spring 2017 with at least 400 attendees.

We will connect donors, alumni, and student members through networking receptions in major cities.

<span style="color: #ffa732;"><strong>Creating safe spaces and fostering diversity.</strong></span>

We will provide a welcoming, open, and safe space for all stakeholders, but especially our members, including those who stand in conflict on other issues, and work to ensure that a wide range of perspectives are represented.

We will actively seek out opportunities for collaboration with other organizations including non-drug policy reform groups and those beyond our traditional allies.

The <a href="http://ssdp.org/diversity/">Diversity, Awareness, Reflection, and Education Committee</a> will create and/or compile resources to assist chapters navigating diversity issues on their campuses, which staff will make accessible to chapters.

We will make every attempt to ensure that SSDP events, including conferences, provide a welcoming environment for current and potential members and strive to provide recognition of their lived experiences.
<h4 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #136f8d;">Education and Advocacy</span></h4>
<strong><span style="color: #ffa732;">Pushing the policy envelope &amp; speaking truth to power.</span></strong>

We will provide training, mentorship, and <a href="http://ssdp.org/resources">resources</a> to change campus and local policies and empower our membership with timely opportunities to take action on state and federal legislation, including meeting with elected officials and decision makers.

We will generate thousands of communications to government officials and decision makers.

Our staff will publish and maintain data on <a href="https://ssdp.org/school-policies/">campus drug policies</a> and <a href="https://ssdp.org/campaigns/call-911-good-samaritan-policies/">Call 911 Good Samaritan policies</a> to serve as expert resources on these issues.

<strong><span style="color: #ffa732;">Educating and empowering students.</span></strong>

We will provide students with a rich menu of <a href="http://cat.ssdp.org/">activities</a> to undertake in three change-making pathways: 1) chapter building, including recruitment, leadership training, and community organizing; 2) training and education, including peer education and expanding their knowledge; and 3) advocacy, including changing policies from the campus to the UN. We will do this work through an intersectional lens that includes harm reduction and public health, international drug policy, human rights, racial justice, civil rights, and constitutional rights.

We will provide students with training in the three pathways of chapter building, policy change, and training and education through:
<ul>
	<li>Skills-building workshops with a total of 500 attendees,</li>
	<li>One-on-one support by outreach staff to 1000 students, and</li>
	<li>Keeping resources/educational materials up to date and making them more easily accessible and navigable including updating each campaign toolkit at least annually.</li>
</ul>
We will connect our students and alumni with opportunities for professional development, including volunteer opportunities and employment with allied organizations, through the <a href="http://ssdp.org/career-services-program/">Career Services Program</a>and distribution of information about compelling opportunities.

We will effectively utilize our special consultative status with the United Nations to ensure that the youth voice of the drug policy reform movement is represented at UN events where drug policy is a central topic.

We will facilitate active youth participation at drug policy conferences and events and SSDP participation in related conferences and events which are not specific to drug policy.

The <a href="http://ssdp.org/campaigns/peer-education-program/">Just Say Know peer education program</a> will promote open and honest dialogue around drug use, drug policy, and drug culture.

<span style="color: #ffa732;"><strong>Highlighting our students and their work.</strong></span>

We will highlight our students and their work through effective storytelling to donors, alumni, and the public — improving depth of data collected — and in hundreds of media reports, letters to the editor, and op-eds, including referring media to student members as often as possible.

We will improve our strong, unified, and professional brand and all team members will endeavor to adhere to brand principles and encourage chapters to do the same by equipping them with the SSDP style guide.

Our online presence will continue to grow and we will validate its impact through data-driven processes:
<ul>
	<li>Facebook presence will grow by 15% as measured by fans (to 60,000) and engagements (to 335),</li>
	<li>Our website will receive more than 190,000 unique visitors and 390,000 pageviews,</li>
	<li>Additionally, our total YouTube views will surpass 2.7 million, and</li>
	<li>Twitter followers will grow to over 30,000.</li>
</ul>
<span style="color: #ffa732;"><strong>Defining high-quality activists and chapters.</strong></span>

Overall, a majority of our chapters will be high-quality, meaning the chapter earns 250 <a href="http://cat.ssdp.org/">CAT</a> Points or achieves two of the three following benchmarks:

(1) earns 75 CAT Points by engaging in a campaign to change at least one drug policy at the campus, local, state level, federal, or international level through activities such as lobbying, submitting letters to the editor, passing student government resolutions, changing a policy, and submitting a case study on a policy change campaign.

(2) earns 50 CAT Points through educational activities such as hosting educational events, hosting film screenings or debates, distributing educational materials, and engaging in direct service volunteering.

(3) earns 75 CAT Points through chapter-building activities such as attending leadership trainings, hosting regular chapter meetings, recruiting and training officers, tabling on campus, and building/maintaining relationships with other organizations on campus.

<span style="color: #ffa732;"><strong>AMPLIFYing our message.</strong></span>

Through a partnership between SSDP and the music community (<a href="http://ssdp.org/amplify/">the AMPLIFY project</a>), SSDP students will reach out at concerts and music festivals to recruit new supporters, provide on-site harm reduction, and educate the public about harm reduction policies, practices, and services.
<h4 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #136f8d;">Organizational Development</span></h4>
<span style="color: #ffa732;"><strong>Cultivating meaningful donor relationships. <i>(January – December 2016)</i></strong></span>
