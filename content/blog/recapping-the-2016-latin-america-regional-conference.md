<span style="font-weight: 400;"><em>Written by Héctor Joel Anaya</em></span>

From 3rd to 4th November, students from around Latin America attended our first <a href="http://epsd.org.mx/conferencia-regional-de-america-latina-2016/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Latin American Regional Conference</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in Morelia, Michoacán. Morelia is one of the states that has been most affected by the Mexican Drug War since former president Felipe Calderon started it ten years ago.<a href="/assets/14890566_10210903002832777_768862007145246771_o-1.jpg"><img class=" wp-image-20534 alignright" src="http://ssdp.org/assets/14890566_10210903002832777_768862007145246771_o-1-195x300.jpg" alt="14890566_10210903002832777_768862007145246771_o-1" width="238" height="366" /></a></span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The conference was divided into three big topics; </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">health, policy, and culture</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> More than 30 panelists were there, including students from different local chapters in </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u65Og_28ckw"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Costa Rica</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_TsOErtcc8&amp;t=1s"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Guadalajara</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cBWAuBaFG9E">Chihuahua</a>,</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> students from other universities not involved
with SSDP, and a diverse array professionals including lawyers, psychiatrists, high-level researchers, and former politicians. Everyone had the chance to speak and share their knowledge and experiences.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The conference began with an opening magistral lecture by the former congressman </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://twitter.com/ferbelaunzaran/status/794346344911540224">Fernando Belaunzaran</a>,</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> one of the most notorious politicians who advocates for cannabis policy reform. We then had two tables, including one on activism and drug policy hosted by Jacki Moreira, an alum of the </span><a href="https://www.facebook.com/ucberkeleyssdp/?fref=ts"><span style="font-weight: 400;">SSDP UCBerkeley </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">chapter and the Latin American Policy Intern at the </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://twitter.com/epsd_ssdpMX/status/794235525162897408">SSDP DC office</a>. Jacki talked about </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> talking us about latino advocacy in America.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">On the second day, we had a member of </span><a href="https://twitter.com/IBDSenado"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Belisario Dominguez Institute</span></i></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> give a special talk about the Mexican Senate in charge of legislative analysis. Carlos Galindo explains how the drug war caused thousands of murders of male youth in Mexico and has plummeted their life expectancy. After, we had a magistral lecture by Phd. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="http://www.ustream.tv/recorded/92612896">Froylán Enciso</a>,</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> a researcher from the </span><a href="https://twitter.com/cideppd"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Drug Policy Program of the Center for Economics and Teaching Studies in Mexico</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> who argues the</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> “War on Drugs began centuries ago w/ attacks on indigenous use of peyote &amp; farmer cultivation of poppy since 1940s.”</span></i>

<span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="/assets/14991405_1580798315280399_268595448321991675_o.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-20533 alignleft" src="http://ssdp.org/assets/14991405_1580798315280399_268595448321991675_o-300x200.jpg" alt="14991405_1580798315280399_268595448321991675_o" width="300" height="200" /></a>For the conclusion, we had two panels about activism, harm reduction and health. And of course a traditional dance party in an awesome LGBTTIQ local club.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">We were very happy to have the Latin American SSDP family join us in Morelia to create a place to discuss new approaches for ending this nonsense drug war. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Start Making Sense from Latin America!</span>
