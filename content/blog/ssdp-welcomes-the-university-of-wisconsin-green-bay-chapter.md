<p id="E9"><span id="E10"><strong>How did you hear about SSDP?</strong> </span></p>
<p id="E11"><span id="E12">I first heard about SSDP through my involvement in the organization Students for Liberty. I also learned about the organization from other activists who have been involved with SSDP including Anna Richter and Daniel Miles. </span></p>
<p id="E13"><span id="E14"><strong>Why did you want to get involved/what made you decide to start a chapter?</strong> </span></p>
<p id="E15"><span id="E16">I decided I wanted to start a SSDP chapter primarily because I see the War on Drugs as a failure and want to recruit and educate people about reform that can be taken to improve the way we as a society deal with drugs. I also noticed through my activism that one of the most popular subjects we address was drug reform and legalization/decriminalization, which showed me the strong support for reform on my campus.</span></p>
<p id="E17"><span id="E18"><strong>What has the reception been like on campus? From students, teachers, administration, etc.</strong> </span></p>
<p id="E19"><span id="E20">The reception on my campus has been highly positive. Most students and staff are highly interested in drug reform and getting involved. The school administration on campus also seems somewhat for reform, especially since our Student Government passed a Good Samaritan Policy on campus last year.</span></p>
<p id="E21"><span id="E22"><strong>What are some of the things you have planned or want to plan for next semester?</strong> </span></p>
<p id="E23"><span id="E24">For next semester I plan on tackling the remaining school policies we have on the books which are not very progressive when it comes to drug and alcohol policy. I also want to ensure students on campus know about the Good Samaritan Policy and ensure that the campus is utilizing the policy properly. </span></p>
<p id="E25"><span id="E26"><strong>What is the most challenging part of your experience starting/running the chapter so far?</strong> </span></p>
<p id="E27"><span id="E28">The most challenging part of starting the chapter so far is that the organization is so far just myself. Though this should get to be easier after our schools Organization fair where I can hopefully gain a large amount interest and attendance at my meetings.</span></p>
<p id="E29"><span id="E30"><strong>What is the most rewarding part?</strong> </span></p>
<p id="E31"><span id="E32">The most rewarding part about being involved with SSDP and creating a group on campus is knowing that I am helping end the War on Drugs and moving society towards a more progressive view of drug policy.</span></p>
<p id="E33"><strong><span id="E34">What are you most excited about for your chapter/school/state/region/</span><span id="E36">ssdp</span><span id="E38">/drug policy right now?</span></strong></p>
<p id="E39"><span id="E40">The thing I am most excited about is merely creating a network on campus for students who support sensible drug policies, especially since no network has really existed here before. I’m also excited to get students mobilized to push for better campus policies regarding drugs and alcohol.</span></p>
<p id="E41"><strong><span id="E42">What is your vision for University of Wisconsin Green Bay SSDP? Where do you see your chapter in a year? </span><span id="E44">in</span><span id="E46"> 4 or 5 years?</span></strong></p>
<p id="E47"><span id="E48">My vision for University of Wisconsin Green Bay SSDP is that it will grow rapidly and become one of our campuses most active student organizations. I’d also like to see the group eradicate bad campus </span>policies <span id="E49">and then move to more local and state issues. I also see it within the next year becoming a stable organization on campus with a complete executive board and weekly meetings. Within the next few years I would like to see the group helping other campuses create SSDP groups creating a statewide network.</span></p>
