Meet Daniel Yee, the chapter leader of <a href="http://ssdp.org/chapters/pacific/california/university-of-california-irvine/" target="_blank">Students for Sensible Drug Policy at University of California Irvine</a>. He is a second year studying Anthropology.

He found out at Students for Sensible Drug Policy through MAPS. He wanted to get involved with drug policy reform because he thought there was a big need for people to be educated about issues pertaining to race and the criminal justice system, especially in California. “It’s kind of far removed from most people’s everyday lives here,” he says.

To Daniel, a sensible drug policy involves not going after drug users as criminals. “We ruin people’s lives for enforcing other people’s morals on them. We should just give people ability and freedom to be who they are.”

For this year, he hopes to invite professors or scientists to come speak at the school to educate the student population and the Irvine community. He and his Executive Board also plan on recruiting more people and spreading the word.

Outside of SSDP, Daniel was involved in the UCI Costa Rica program, where he did a research project on sustainable farming, and then came back and taught other UCI students about it. He has also played the cello for 14 years, starting from when he was 5.
