Surveillance video from a Florida home shows police playing Wii bowling during a drug raid.
<blockquote>As investigators searched the home for drugs, some drug task force members found other ways to occupy their time. Within 20 minutes of entering Difalco&#8217;s house, some of the investigators found a Wii video bowling game and began bowling frame after frame.</blockquote>

To be fair &#8211; Wii is pretty addictive. So I can understand why the <a href="http://www2.tbo.com/content/2009/sep/21/undercover-drug-investigators-embarrass-polk-sheri/news-breaking/">officers spent a good hour</a>of the drug raid glued to the TV. Isn&#8217;t it ironic?

&#8220;Well, we were really bored&#8221; explained <a href="http://www.mcgruff.org/">Det. Scruff McGruff</a>, who was present during the raid. &#8220;Drug raids can take hours, but in this case, we finished up pretty quickly and just didn&#8217;t feel like going back to work. Before we found the Wii, we were planning on snorting some of meth we confiscated and playing Duck Hunt with our real guns &#8211; thank God we found the Wii.&#8221;
