<strong>Name</strong>: Nicholas Davies

<strong>Chapter</strong>: Front Range Community College

<strong>Location</strong>: Longmont, Colorado <strong></strong>

<strong>When did you first get involved with SSDP and why do you like being part of the organization? </strong>
I was first introduced to SSDP during my second year in Student Government when I was fortunate enough to meet a fellow by the name of Christopher Pezza. After a few legislative sessions Chris and I found that we had similar thoughts on many issues regarding drug policy and the way it should be approached (not to forget a liking for &#8220;The Talking Heads&#8221;).

At the time he was also founding our current chapter at the college and was in need of help getting it going. I agreed one day to attend a meeting and from then on forth have considered myself a drug policy activist. What I like about being part of this organization is that it gives a forum for like minded people to pool their ideas and knowledge to create a positive impact on their local communities.
<strong>What issues are important for the Front Range Community College SSDP chapter? </strong>
At this point one of our biggest issues at hand is changing the data; It&#8217;s difficult to be taken seriously as a student&#8217;s organization with out being able to own up to one&#8217;s &#8220;student responsibilities.&#8221;
<strong>Do you have any events/campaigns planned? </strong>
One of our chapter mantras is to <strong>always have at least one event planned</strong>. We just finished the final week of the semester with an event where we reserved our community room for students looking for a quiet place to study. Along with the quiet study space we were given tea from the Environmental Club to provide students with a nice perk to their day. This event being is a part of our &#8220;A&#8217;s before J&#8217;s&#8221; campaign encouraging students and current SSDP members (and all students) to prioritize their grades before their recreational use of drugs including alcohol.

<strong>What has been your favorite experience with SSDP?</strong>
Knowing that every action we take gets us closer to a better America. That experience in itself is invaluable.
<strong>Do you have any advice for other chapter leaders? </strong>
Know that in the action of being a student; That role, when completed with pride, will only lead to gains for our goals, and falter those whom criticize our intent.

That and go to new student orientation. Have a table. Something. It is a way to get members hooked at the very get go of the semester. If anything do it just to inform.
