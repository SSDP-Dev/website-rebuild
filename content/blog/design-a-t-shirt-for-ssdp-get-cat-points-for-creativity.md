<span style="font-weight: 400">As the 2016-17 school year approaches, SSDP is looking to add new swag to our collection, with the help of our very own network! SSDP is holding our 2016-17 t-shirt design contest, where SSDPers have the chance to enter their own design to be considered for our new SSDP merch. The only requirement is that the shirt must be in line with SSDP’s values (i.e., nothing that advocates for drug use, etc). Even if you’re not a designer, you can submit a design idea in words or any other format that would convey your ideas.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400">Each design entry will earn 5 CAT points, so be sure to share the contest with your fellow chapter members. Send your designs to </span><a href="mailto:karen.walker@ssdp.org"><span style="font-weight: 400">karen.walker@ssdp.org</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> by next Tuesday, August 23 at 11:59pm PST to be considered. Remember to include your full name and chapter with your submission. Please note that the design may be modified and may be produced only after a final design has been approved by the SSDP staff. Your shirt could be worn by SSDPers across the globe, so what’s there to lose?! Designers, you have one week, so let’s get the creativity flowing!</span>
