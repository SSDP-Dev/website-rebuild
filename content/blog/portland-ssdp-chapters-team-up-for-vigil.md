SSDP chapters at <a title="Reed College" href="http://ssdp.org/chapters/west-coast/oregon/reed-college/" target="_blank">Reed College</a> and <a href="http://ssdp.org/chapters/western/oregon/lewis-clark" target="_blank">Lewis &amp; Clark College</a> in Portland, OR, teamed up this past Friday and <a href="http://www.examiner.com/medical-marijuana-dispensaries-in-portland/candlelight-vigil-at-pioneer-square-marks-40-year-anniversary-of-war-on-drugs" target="_blank">organized a candlelight vigil</a> to commemorate those impacted by the failed war on drugs. Over 100 people were in attendance. The Portland chapters placed a focus on the struggle of medical marijuana patients in their state and throughout the country who needlessly suffer and face criminal prosecution for using cannabis. One of those patients was interviewed in the above video and explained that the war on medical marijuana forces patients into a dangerous black market:

<blockquote>&#8220;People are going to die. And they’re not going to die because of their disease. They&#8217;re going to die because they&#8217;re going to go out on the streets, and they&#8217;re going to try to buy medicine there. They&#8217;re going to get ripped off, and then they&#8217;re going to stand up for themselves and then somebody is going to end up dying because of it,&#8221; he said. &#8220;The federal government is not getting a piece of it. That&#8217;s what it boils down to. In the meantime, people are going to die.&#8221;</blockquote>

The vigil was one of 22 that took place across the U.S. and in Mexico City and featured speakers from SSDP, LEAP, Sensible Washington, and the Oregon Tax Cannabis Act 2012.



Stay tuned for more video and photos from other vigils!
