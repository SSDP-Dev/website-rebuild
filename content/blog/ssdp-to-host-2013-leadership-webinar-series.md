Each semester, we host an ongoing series of webinars aimed at making you the best SSDPer you can be by addressing important areas of leadership and chapter management based on our years of SSDP experience. These training webinars are ideal for any chapter member, new or old, and will help you craft your leadership style by honing your recruitment, delegation, event planning, and fundraising techniques.



Aditionally, we are hosting two extra webinars this semester! One will address getting your voice heard by the media, and include information on writing press releases, Letters-to-the-editor, Op-Eds, and more. The second will address effective ways you can get elected officials and others ‘on the record’ about their views on the drug war.



So, stay tuned! These are extremely important tools at your disposal. Please tune in to our upcoming webinars to see how you can continue to hone your Swiss Army activist toolkit.



<a href="http://ssdp.org/resources/ssdp-leadership-webinar-series/">*The first webinar will take place on January 17th, and will address creative recruitment methods on campus. See you there!*
