<span style="font-weight: 400">In the United States,</span> <a href="https://www.loc.gov/lgbt-pride-month/about/"><span style="font-weight: 400">June is celebrated as LGBT Pride Month</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> in honor of the</span> <a href="https://ssdp.org/blog/november-monthly-mosaic/"><span style="font-weight: 400">1969 Stonewall riots</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">, which were a key tipping point for the Gay Liberation Movement in the United States. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">In many ways, </span><span style="font-weight: 400">drugs and queerness are undeniably linked. Both using drugs and identifying as queer unfortunately still carry certain stigmas in modern society. In addition to the dehumanization people who use drugs and people who identify as LGBT+ can encounter, both groups are often unfairly portrayed as the sole creators of the problems they face. While, of course, the choice to use drugs cannot fully equate to something so inborn as gender or sexual identity, we must also remind ourselves that </span><a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/the-addictive-personality-isn-t-what-you-think-it-is/"><span style="font-weight: 400">addiction is not a choice</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">.</span>

<b>STIGMA, SEXUALITY, AND DRUG USE</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400">While, of course, all drug use is not abused and many people are able to use drugs in responsible manners, an estimated </span><a href="https://www.americanprogress.org/issues/lgbt/reports/2012/03/09/11228/why-the-gay-and-transgender-population-experiences-higher-rates-of-substance-use/"><span style="font-weight: 400">20-30 % of gay and transgender people suffer from problematic substance use, compared to about 9% of the general population.</span></a>

<a href="http://www.lgbttobacco.org/truth.php?ID=15"><span style="font-weight: 400">Gay and transgender people smoke tobacco up to 200% more</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> than their heterosexual and cisgender peers, and </span><a href="http://www.kap.samhsa.gov/products/manuals/pdfs/lgbt.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400">25% of gay and transgender people abuse alcohol, compared to 5-10% of the general population</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">.</span>

<a href="http://pride-institute.com/programs/lgbt-treatment/lgbt-drug-abuse/"><span style="font-weight: 400">Few studies have looked at drug use in the lesbian community</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">, but what little information there is suggests that </span><a href="http://pride-institute.com/programs/lgbt-treatment/lgbt-drug-abuse/"><span style="font-weight: 400">drug abuse occurs at higher rates among lesbians than heterosexual women and could equal the rates of occurrence in gay men</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">Stigma plays a huge role.

<h2><b>PERSONAL STORY: ANDREW HOOD</b></h2>
<i><span style="font-weight: 400">Key to </span></i><a href="https://ssdp.org/dare/"><i><span style="font-weight: 400">SSDP-DARE</span></i></a><i><span style="font-weight: 400">’s mission is elevating the </span></i><a href="http://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/acref/9780199568758.001.0001/acref-9780199568758-e-1552"><i><span style="font-weight: 400">lived experiences</span></i></a><i><span style="font-weight: 400"> of those who have been impacted by the War on Drugs. Here, we here from UT Austin chapter leader Andrew Hood, a key contributor to this issue of the </span></i><a href="https://ssdp.org/?s=monthly+mosaic"><span style="font-weight: 400">Monthly Mosaic</span></a><i><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8230; </span></i>

<span style="font-weight: 400">One of the main reasons I began to experiment with drugs was because I was LGBT.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">I had long since been fascinated with pharmacology, and the social pressures of high school had just begun to sink in. In so many ways, high school is everything it is stereotyped to be: cliques exist, labels are applied, and people can be notoriously unpleasant. By my freshman year, I knew that I would likely soon be labeled “the gay kid” in my graduating class. There was one openly gay student in the class before me. Everyone knew his name and the fact that he was gay — but nothing about who he was a person, nothing about his hobbies or interests, and few even had a clear picture of what he looked like.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">I was never one to stay firmly and totally in the closet. Feeling doomed to be labeled deviant because of my sexuality, I chose instead to be publicly deviant with my substance use. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">I wanted people to know I did drugs. I wanted people to think I was wild so much more than I wanted to be known as “the gay kid.” I wanted some sort of identity other than “the gay kid” in a whitewashed Houston suburb.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">I allowed myself to become that person because it afforded me large social graces. As the social dynamics of 2011 suburbia dictated at the time, it was weird for straight people (especially men) to hang out with the “gay kid” as friends. Yet, it was much less weird to hang out with someone to do drugs. Our shared drug use allowed for a connection that would otherwise be socially taboo.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">I fell into periods that could probably be called a “bad habit” as a result, but today I’d probably still argue that it was worth it. Worth it to not be “the gay kid.” Worth it to feel humanized —  in a roundabout way. </span>
