<b><i>Tips for NIDA chat questions:</i></b>
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Be sure to use well-framed, open-ended questions that force a thoughtful answer</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Avoid asking about policy-related things, as you may get canned response or risk your question not getting answered</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Focus on questions related to the science behind drugs and drug use, as this is the expertise of the folks responding to questions</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Do ask about harm reduction practices as we want to get them on the record discussing Harm Reduction</span>
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">For example, you could ask non-policy related questions about drug checking, because their answers about molly/mdma/ecstasy last year did not address this issue.</span></li>
</ul>
</li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Do ask questions on stigma and drug use as we want to get them on the record talking about how drug users are stigmatized</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ask questions about New Psychoactive Substances (NPS)</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ask questions related to college-aged students, as much of the NADFW seems to be geared toward younger students, though many colleges and universities participate on some level.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ask about recent psychedelic medicine research related to mental health conditions</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">For more question ideas, take a </span><a href="https://teens.drugabuse.gov/national-drug-alcohol-facts-week/chat-with-scientists/search?year=2016"><span style="font-weight: 400;">look at the transcript from the 2016 chat</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, or review their most </span><a href="https://teens.drugabuse.gov/national-drug-alcohol-facts-week/chat-with-scientists/frequently-asked-questions"><span style="font-weight: 400;">frequently asked questions</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></li>
