Update: The UStream broadcast mentioned below has been canceled. It will be rescheduled.

Friends,

I&#8217;d like to let you know that I&#8217;m alive and well &#8212; albeit intellectually exhausted &#8212; following my attendance at the DARE conference this week.

I have video clips and insights to share, but I&#8217;ll save those for my UStream broadcast next week. I hope you can tune in:

WHO:
SSDP members everywhere.
Hosted by yours truly (Micah Daigle, SSDP Associate Director).

WHAT:
Recap of the DARE conference and discussion of SSDP&#8217;s role in promoting effective drug education programs.
(UStream allows participants to discuss topics within a chat room, while the host leads the discussion via video feed.)

WHEN:
Wednesday, August 20th
9pm Eastern, 6pm Pacific

WHERE:
<a href="http://www.ustream.tv/channel/ssdp-chat">http://www.ustream.tv/channel/ssdp-chat</a>

In the meantime, I&#8217;ll be editing my footage together into a video to post on the internets and YouTubes. The footage varies from interviews with genuinely good-hearted DARE officers talking about the relationships they&#8217;ve built with young people through their time teaching the program, to die-hard zealots preaching about their disdain for evidence-based education programs and harm-reduction.

Although the latter footage is much more damning (and thus valuable to those who oppose the DARE program), I&#8217;m going to do my best to portray my experience at the conference in a fair light. We may score quick points by being selective about what we see and hear, but we&#8217;ll never win this fight if we become zealots like the prohibitionists who oppose us.

Until next time&#8230;
