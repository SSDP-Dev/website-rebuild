84 years ago today, alcohol prohibition was repealed in the United States with the ratification of the 21st Amendment. From 1920-1933, the prohibition of alcohol caused rampant violence linked to criminal organizations that controlled the supply of illegal alcohol; wasted government spending in a futile effort to stop people from drinking; and consumption of dangerous, unregulated products of unknown provenance. Of course, it was all in the name of protecting children.

Sounds familiar.

Today, alcohol prohibition is a distant memory, but the same prohibitionist approaches to cannabis and other drugs are causing those same old problems. Students for Sensible Drug Policy &lt;https://ssdp.org&gt; is at the forefront of ending the senseless policies of the global War on Drugs. Students have been at the vanguard of drug policy reform for 20 years, and we envision a future without prohibition. We are working toward a future where young people will no longer have their lives derailed because of a drug conviction, where students are not afraid to call for help during drug-related emergencies. We demand a public health-based approach to drug policy, not one that criminalizes people.

<a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B7fh6jX33lH5SW9CQU0tRkwtQWs/view">Check out our annual report</a> to see the incredible strides we&#8217;ve made in the past year toward that vision. The 2016-17 school year was a banner year for SSDP with students engaging in voter outreach, policy change, community education, and direct action in order to further our vision of ending the War on Drugs. We know you&#8217;ll be as inspired by our student members as we are.

Make a gift today to celebrate Repeal Day &#8212; and to propel us into a more sensible future.
