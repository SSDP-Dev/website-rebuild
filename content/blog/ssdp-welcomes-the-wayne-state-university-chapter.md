<p id="E55"><span id="E56" class="qowt-font1-Calibri">Making changes around campus for the most part; just like any other person, I like to see the fruits of my labor manifest into something bigger. Making a change on campus and hopefully beyond really appealed to me – especially given the fact that dealt with something that I am intrinsically interested in.</span></p>

<p id="E60"><span id="E61" class="qowt-font1-Calibri">We are set to kick off the semester soon so we haven’t had any meetings yet; but I believe that my school will be open to many of the principles that embody SSDP</span></p>

<p id="E65"><span id="E66" class="qowt-font1-Calibri">Being in the city of Detroit, drug addiction and crime are rampant. Wayne State’s campus police patrol an area of Detroit that is larger than the campus itself; and so, I would like to establish a Good Samaritan policy and train our campus force with handling </span><span id="E68" class="qowt-font1-Calibri">Narcan</span></p>

<p id="E72"><span id="E73" class="qowt-font1-Calibri">I’m honestly just a really busy person so putting together this club with minimal help has been slightly troublesome; but overall I would say that it hasn’t been as challenging as I anticipated.</span></p>

<p id="E77"><span id="E78" class="qowt-font1-Calibri">Knowing that the campaigns SSDP runs can make a difference on a community level seems like it would be the most rewarding part of the experience</span><span id="E79" class="qowt-font1-Calibri">. It is really eye opening knowing that your effort could go noticed by the whole student body.</span></p>

<p id="E86"><span id="E87" class="qowt-font1-Calibri">Michigan is one of the few states that is on the forefront to legalizing recreational use of marijuana, most people that I have spoken to realize that possession/consumption should not result in incarceration nor detainment; so hopefully working to legalize weed in Michigan is going to be a thrill. </span></p>
<p id="E88" class="qowt-li-0_0 qowt-list"><strong><span id="E89" class="qowt-font1-Calibri">What is your vision for Wayne State SSDP?
