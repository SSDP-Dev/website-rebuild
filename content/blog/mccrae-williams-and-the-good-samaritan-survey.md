<em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Note: CW &#8211; the following post contains discussion of alcohol use and traumatic injury leading to death.</span></em>

<em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Co-written by Vilmarie Narloch ‘09 and Dianne and Chris Williams.</span></em>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">McCrae Williams tragically passed away in September of 2017, while attending Lafayette College, where he was recruited to play Division 1 lacrosse as a goalie. Although his life was cut tragically short, he lived a life full of incredible experiences. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Wherever he went and whatever he did, he had a </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">smile and an infectious spirit that transcended all. He had an unbelievable ability to connect with people of all ages. He was supportive and kind and never expected anything in return.</span>

After his fall, he was placed in his bed and was “Jansported” (also known as </span><a href="https://www.nbcphiladelphia.com/news/local/Jansporting-College-Kids-Using-Backpacks-to-Prop-Up-Intoxicated-Friends-446166633.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">drunkpacking</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2017/09/29/experts-say-new-jansporting-trend-dangerous"><span style="font-weight: 400;">backpacking</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> or turtling), which is when a backpack filled with books or other heavy items is strapped to someone who appears drunk. The person is then laid on their side to prevent possible aspiration of their vomit. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">In McCrae’s situation, he was then left alone until 4pm the next day, 22 hours after his fall, when some fellow students decided to get him into a car in order to bring him to a medical facility. The coaching staff found out what was happening and someone called 911. McCrae was taken to a hospital where he was later pronounced brain dead and passed away the following day.  </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">McCrae’s family started the </span><a href="http://mccraewilliams.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">McCrae James Williams Foundation</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in his memory to advocate for Good Samaritan Policies across college campuses and to expose the dangerous practice of “Jansporting”.  </span>

<div id="attachment_33906" style="width: 334px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img class=" wp-image-33906" src="https://ssdp.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/MW3-with-charcoal-blue-white-ORIGINAL.jpeg" alt="" width="324" height="324" srcset="https://ssdp.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/MW3-with-charcoal-blue-white-ORIGINAL.jpeg 1024w, https://ssdp.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/MW3-with-charcoal-blue-white-ORIGINAL-768x768.jpeg 768w, https://ssdp.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/MW3-with-charcoal-blue-white-ORIGINAL-150x150.jpeg 150w, https://ssdp.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/MW3-with-charcoal-blue-white-ORIGINAL-200x200.jpeg 200w" sizes="(max-width: 324px) 100vw, 324px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">[Image Description: McCrae James Williams Foundation logo, containing his lacrosse number, 3, and his initials, M.W.]</p></div><span style="font-weight: 400;">In an effort to understand this practice of “Jansporting&#8221;, they have developed a survey for college students on backpacking and Good Samaritan Policies. They want to find out what students know about Jansporting, how prevalent it is, their knowledge of Good Samaritan Policies, and how comfortable they are calling for help when someone is in need of medical attention.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Thus far, McCrae’s family has collected about 900 responses and are hoping to collect even more. The responses will be used to help develop a media effort that will educate people on the practice of “Jansporting” and the importance of Good Samaritan Policies. So far, they are finding that young people are using this tactic as a substitute for calling for help. Additionally, they have found that athletes are significantly less likely to call for help, as they are often not afforded the protection of Good Samaritan Policies. In cases where student athletes call for help, their coaches or athletic department staff are often notified, which more often than not results in punishments such as suspensions from games or activities. Additionally, many students recognize the need to call for help in a particular situation but don’t out of fear of getting in trouble. </span>
