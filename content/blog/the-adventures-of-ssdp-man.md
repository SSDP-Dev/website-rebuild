Please check out the <a href="http://www.ssdp.org/sendus">many fantastic videos</a> we received for the the Seeds of Reform conference scholarship party. You&#8217;ll find a wide spectrum of creative submissions from chapters all around the country letting you know why they need to come to <a href="http://www.ssdp.org/conference">SSDP&#8217;s 11th Annual International Drug Policy Conference</a>. The students at our UMD chapter tried their hand at rapping about drug policy, Fitchburg State College hopes to lend a helping hand to a community in need, and Northern Virginia Community College introduced the world to the most needed super hero yet, SSDP Man!

In case you&#8217;re wondering, the <a href="http://www.ssdp.org/seeds">Seeds of Reform Party</a> was a huge success and raised over$20,000 for SSDP&#8217;s conference scholarship fund! I&#8217;ll post more details and pictures from the party shortly.
