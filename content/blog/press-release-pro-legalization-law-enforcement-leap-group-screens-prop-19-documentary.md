<strong>Special Preview and Panel Discussion Planned in Long Beach</strong>



Long Beach, Calif. – As debates over ballot measures to legalize marijuana heat up in Colorado, Oregon and Washington, a group of cops, judges and other law enforcement officers calling for an end to the war on drugs is holding a special sneak peek at Legalize It, a new documentary about Prop. 19, the 2010 California campaign to legalize and regulate marijuana like alcohol. On October 24, Law Enforcement Against Prohibition (LEAP), in conjunction with Willie Nelson&#8217;s Luck Films and award-winning filmmakers Dan Katzir and Ravit Markus, will host a special screening and discussion panel of the film at the Art Theatre of Long Beach.



• Legalize It, a documentary about the Prop. 19 campaign

• Wednesday, October 24, 2012 7-10pm

• Art Theatre of Long Beach, 2025 E. 4th Street, Long Beach

• Tickets are available online and start at $10. There are also a number of sponsorship packages available. Please see the website <a href="www.leap.cc/california-benefit/" target="_blank">www.leap.cc/california-benefit/</a> or contact Diane Goldstein (diane.goldstein@leap.cc or 714.232.3722) for more info.



For the documentary, filmmakers followed members of the campaign for eight months, documenting the unlikely alliances that developed and the minor victories and setbacks of the first serious effort to legalize marijuana in the United States. Legalize It is a sensitive and humorous behind-the-scenes look at a colorful campaign, the unlikely people running it and the disparate groups who both opposed and endorsed it. Several LEAP speakers appear in the film.



“In any battle, the people who go in first are going to take one hell of a beating. In the fight to legalize marijuana, the Prop. 19 campaign folks were those people. If and when ballot measures in other states succeed, it will be because these folks cleared the way.”

– LEAP Executive Director Neill Franklin



After the film, a discussion panel including a former LAPD deputy chief who appears in the documentary, drug policy reform advocates, local dignitaries and one of the film’s producers will discuss the Prop. 19 campaign as well as the current political outlook for similar efforts at reform.
