<span style="font-weight: 400;">From Friday, March 2nd to Monday, March 5th, 2018, SSDP will be celebrating its 20th Anniversary at <a href="https://conference.ssdp.org/">SSDP2018</a>, this year’s International SSDP Conference in Baltimore, Maryland, USA. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">In line with our values of democracy, transparency, and accountability, SSDP Congress convenes annually to give each chapter in the network the opportunity to </span><b>elect new student members to the Board of Directors</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and to </span><b>vote on resolutions for the organization</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span>
<h1><span style="font-weight: 400;">Voting on Resolutions for SSDP</span></h1>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Resolutions are non-binding statements, submitted by chapters (or sometimes by the Board of Directors) and voted on during the annual Congress. Resolutions are considered by the Board and Staff, and help guide the growth and direction of SSDP. They are an opportunity for members to share their vision for SSDP or which items which they feel should be included in the organization’s agenda. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">A template and sample resolution can be found </span><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1c06rpqUu_ZrdWrUis9iXZaDPTIUJTe6jr42gjDtiG3g/edit?usp=sharing"><span style="font-weight: 400;">here</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span>
<h1><span style="font-weight: 400;">Electing Student Members to the Board of Directors</span></h1>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">As a nonprofit organization, SSDP is governed by the Board of Directors. The Board is responsible for ensuring the financial stability of the organization, crafting and approving the organization’s strategy, and hiring and evaluating the Executive Director. It also represents SSDP’s chapters at the international level. The powers of the Board of Directors are outlined in </span><a href="http://ssdp.org/about/board/bylaws/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">SSDP’s Bylaws</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">SSDP is unique among nonprofit organizations because two-thirds of the Board are student directors that are elected annually by their peers. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Being on the Board of Directors requires more than just passion for social change and an interest in public policy. We are seeking individuals with demonstrated enthusiasm and success throughout their involvement with SSDP, including having earned CAT points, having attended past SSDP conferences or regional gatherings, or having organized successful events, demonstrations, or communities. Being a Director requires both teamwork and independence, and we want to work with people who have demonstrated enthusiasm, participation, and leadership.</span>
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Student Directors must have excellent written and verbal communication skills and be able to take on an administrative role. </span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Student Directors are expected to devote a significant amount of time to Board tasks and assignments, to frequently check and respond to email, and to comply with deadlines for meetings. </span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Student Directors serve on Board committees that have individual responsibilities. </span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Student Directors must fundraise for SSDP; each Director is expected to raise at least $1000 each year by asking friends, family and colleagues for donations. </span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Student Directors are also asked to attend SSDP’s annual Strategy Summit at their own expense, which typically takes place in June in either Washington, DC, Denver, CO or Oakland, CA.</span></li>
</ul>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">We strongly encourage all who believe they can make this commitment to apply. Serving on the Board of Directors of SSDP is an invaluable, incredibly rewarding experience. You will play a major part in growing SSDP and helping to end the drug war while gaining a unique experience generally only available to people in later stages of life.</span>
<h1><span style="font-weight: 400;">Board of Directors Application</span></h1>
<b>There are six open student director positions to be filled during the March 2018 Congress.</b> <b>The organization&#8217;s bylaws define a “student” as someone who is currently enrolled at least half-time at university as an undergraduate or graduate student, in high school, or who graduated within the last academic year. Anyone who graduated in the spring 2017 or fall 2017 semester is eligible to run. Both US and international students are encouraged to run.</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">To apply to be a candidate, please fill out this </span><a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfKXmYz99Iuq1DzbWCdptpTjhICkmSxO3XWvHdnA9gJx5TttA/viewform?usp=sf_link"><span style="font-weight: 400;">application form</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Candidate profiles will include information submitted from the application as well as the number of CAT points your chapter has earned during your tenure and annual fundraising totals. Those profiles will be available publicly online for chapters to review and available at Congress.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">After applications are submitted, candidates will be required to attend Congress 101, a brief conference call to prepare the candidates for Congress. The Congress 101 call will take place a week before the conference; the date will be announced after the application process is complete.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">At Congress, candidates will introduce themselves and participate in a question and answer session where students, Board members and staff can ask questions pertaining to a candidate’s fitness to be a Director.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">For candidates who cannot attend Congress, their application materials (and videos if possible) will be made available, and shown at Congress. It is unlikely that candidates who are not physically present will be able to participate in the Q &amp; A.</span>

<b>Applications are due by February 7 at 11:59 PM PST. </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Please send your application through </span><a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfKXmYz99Iuq1DzbWCdptpTjhICkmSxO3XWvHdnA9gJx5TttA/viewform?usp=sf_link"><span style="font-weight: 400;">the application link</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and send any questions to ismail.ali@board.ssdp.org</span>
<h1><span style="font-weight: 400;">Who can vote?</span></h1>
<b>All currently active chapters are eligible to vote. </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">One member from each active chapter will be the voting representative at Congress at SSDP2018. For active chapters unable to send a representative to Congress, </span><b>a digital voting period will be open for 24 hours from Friday (3/2) &#8211; Saturday (3/3)</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> &#8211; more details to come. For chapters that have at least one member attending SSDP2018, the voting will take place in person on Saturday, March 3. For chapters at SSDP2018, attendance at Congress is a requirement to vote, and each chapter needs to select a single voting member. If you are unsure if your chapter is currently “active,” or what needs to be done to make your chapter active, please contact the email address above. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Please make sure your chapter members receive this and encourage everyone who is interested to run. We look forward to receiving </span><a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfKXmYz99Iuq1DzbWCdptpTjhICkmSxO3XWvHdnA9gJx5TttA/viewform?usp=sf_link"><span style="font-weight: 400;">your applications</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> soon!</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">with love,</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Students for Sensible Drug Policy Board of Directors</span>
