I am so excited to announce the formation of our newest official chapter, <a title="CNU SSDP" href="http://ssdp.org/chapters/mid-atlantic/virginia/christopher-newport-university-cnu/" target="_blank">Christopher Newport University (CNU)</a> in Newport News, Virginia! With the addition of CNU, our <a title="SSDP chapters in Virginia" href="http://ssdp.org/chapters/mid-atlantic/virginia/" target="_blank">Virginia network</a> now boasts 7 chapters and is stronger than ever. I spoke with chapter founder and leader Colin Klimowski about the chapter&#8217;s beginnings and his vision for it&#8217;s future:



&nbsp;



<strong>How did you hear about SSDP?</strong>



I heard about SSDP on Facebook, and after attempting to start a NORML chapter on our campus, I was recommended to &#8220;like&#8221; the SSDP Facebook page. I ended up liking SSDP&#8217;s stances and broader approach a little more, and the rest is history.



&nbsp;



<strong>Why did you want to get involved/what made you decide to start a chapter?</strong>



I really enjoy SSDP&#8217;s non-overbearing stance and message. I also really enjoy the transparency from people who run SSDP (DREW!). These two factors plus our campus&#8217; need for an outlet for this kind of message inspired me and the current executive board to start the chapter.



&nbsp;



<strong>What has the reception been like on campus so far?</strong>



<strong></strong>Two sided: those who are willing to help and are supportive of the movement are overwhelmingly so, while those who are not supportive are also overwhelmingly not supportive. We attend a small, liberal arts college, so this is what I expected! (and why we continue!)



&nbsp;



<strong>What are some of the things you have planned or want to plan for next semester?</strong>



We want to have a member of <a title="SSDP Speakers Bureau" href="http://ssdp.org/resources/speakers/" target="_blank">LEAP come speak</a> at CNU! We also want to have a regular weekly table set up in our student union during peak hours (11am-1pm). Our goal is to become on of the most recognized student organization on campus.



&nbsp;



<strong>What is the most challenging part of your experience starting/running the chapter so far?</strong>



<strong></strong>Going through the motions of getting the chapter on paper. CNU has a lot of required paperwork and seminars for new clubs. Once we jumped through the bureaucraticÂ &#8220;hoops,&#8221; the administration approved us very quickly.



&nbsp;



<strong>What is the most rewarding part?</strong>



The most rewarding part has been being awarded recognition as an official student organization at CNU!



&nbsp;



<strong>What are you most excited about for your chapter/school/state/region/<wbr />ssdp/drug policy right now?</strong>



We are very excited to network and work with nearby chapters in Virginia. <a title="VCU SSDP" href="http://ssdp.org/chapters/mid-atlantic/virginia/virginia-commonwealth-university-vcu/" target="_blank">Virginia Commonwealth University (VCU)</a> and <a title="William and Mary SSDP" href="http://ssdp.org/chapters/mid-atlantic/virginia/william-and-mary/" target="_blank">College of William and Mary</a> both have very strong chapters chapters and we can&#8217;t wait to work with and learn from them.



&nbsp;



<strong>What is your vision for CNU SSDP? Where do you see your chapter in a year? in 4 or 5 years?</strong>



I see our chapter being the most prominent student-run activist organization on campus.



&nbsp;
