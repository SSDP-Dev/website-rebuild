We&#8217;re excited to announce the two newest additions to our <a href="http://ssdp.org/chapters">chapter network</a> this week. Welcome to the team, <a title="Manchester University" href="http://ssdp.org/chapters/midwest/indiana/manchester-university">Manchester University</a> and <a href="http://ssdp.org/chapters/midwest/ohio/ohio-state-university">Ohio State University</a> SSDP chapters!



<strong>Manchester University SSDP</strong>



Currently the only SSDP chapter in the state of Indiana, Manchester College SSDP is holding their own in the Hoosier state. Lead by Phil Keim, a Sophomore getting his degree in Peace Studies, this chapter just got started this semester. They recently attended the 2011 Midwest Regional SSDP Conference in Chicago, IL, where they got connected to the Midwest chapter network for the first time. Manchester College SSDP utilized this time to strategize for campus, local, and state reform. They realize they have a lot on their hands being the only chapter in the state, but they are organized and up to the task. So, watch out! These amazing activists are gonna be making big changes real soon.



<strong>Ohio State University SSDP </strong>



Ohio State joined our expansive statewide Ohio SSDP Network this fall semester. Erin Harvey started an SSDP chapter at OSU this semester after hearing about us through Erica Upshaw, at Keep Friendship Alive. Keep Friendship Alive aims to prevent senseless deaths by educating students on how to party smart, identify and approach a friend with a problem, and most importantly – what to do in an emergency situation. Erica got involved to help institute a <a href="http://ssdp.org/campaigns/good-samaritan-policies">Good Samaritan Policy</a> on her campus. She has been active ever since, and is off to a great start!



&nbsp;



We are very excited to welcome two new chapters to our student network! Feel free to reach out to Phil or Erin, and welcome them yourselves; Especially if you are in the Midwest or Ohio.
