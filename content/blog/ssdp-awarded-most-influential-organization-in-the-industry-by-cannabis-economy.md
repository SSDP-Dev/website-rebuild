On December 12th, 2015,<a href="http://www.canneconomy.com/about" target="_blank"> Cannabis Economy</a> hosted the <a href="http://www.canneconomy.com/cannawards" target="_blank">CannAwards</a> in Denver, Colorado. CannAwards honor and celebrate leadership and innovation in the Cannabis industry. We were honored to receive the award for &#8220;Most Influential Organization in the Industry&#8221;.

This award goes to: &#8220;an organization that has demonstrated leadership in the industry. This organization is a visionary that creates passion in others, brings positive tension to the industry, adds value and is truly helping the Cannabis industry move forward.&#8221;

We were happy not only to receive this award, but also to bring current SSDP chapter leaders to the event. The SSDP table was full of our amazing alumni and spectacular students who got to interact with some of the best and brightest that the legal marijuana industry has to offer.

We&#8217;d like to once again thank our students for their hard work in shaping this emerging industry, keeping it accountable and socially responsible, and of course, another thank you to the organizers of the CannAwards for their consideration of our students and the work that we do here at Students for Sensible Drug Policy.
