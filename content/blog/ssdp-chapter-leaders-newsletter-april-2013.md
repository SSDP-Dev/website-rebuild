<b>Second Annual West Coast SSDP Regional Camping Trip</b>

<i>BELDEN, CALIFORNIA &#8211; Friday August 9-11, 2013 </i>

Last year’s West Coast Campout was such a success that this year our Alumni have started planning it earlier!

The Second Annual West Coast SSDP Regional Campout will be held in beautiful Belden, California. <a href="http://org.salsalabs.com/dia/track.jsp?key=-1&amp;url_num=27&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fssdp.org%2Fevents%2Fsecond-annual-west-coast-ssdp-campout%2F" target="_blank">More information.
