<p dir="ltr"><strong>How did you hear about SSDP?</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">I had heard about SSDP from several of my friends within a group called Students for Liberty, and thought that a chapter at OU would be successful.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Why did you want to get involved/what made you decide to start a chapter?</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">I believe that the Drug War in America has caused a horrible pattern of violence and human suffering, and that it is a failed program supported by faulty evidence. A student group at my university would help in the overall effort to bring the Drug War to an end.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>What has the reception been like on campus? From students, teachers, administration, etc.</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">While there’s a good deal of indifference about the drug issue amongst faculty, students are much more positive overall. All it takes is getting the word out that a group like this exists on campus.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>What are some of the things you have planned or want to plan for next semester?</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">We’d like to host at least a couple events this semester, and we’ll also be focused on recruitment as well as getting the chapter established on campus.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>What is the most challenging part of your experience starting/running the chapter so far?</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">Starting any student group is hard. Stoking a passion for activism in other students is like talking to a brick wall. So spreading these ideas to a largely apathetic campus is definitely a challenge.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>What is the most rewarding part?</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">Whenever somebody starts regularly attending meetings, you start talking with them, and they get involved. There’s a great feeling of not only adding their efforts to the cause, but of also making new friends.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>What are you most excited about for your chapter/school/state/region/<wbr />ssdp/drug policy right now?</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">I’m excited about the new cannabis legalization initiative for 2016. But I’m also excited about the opportunity we have to challenge unconstitutional and unsafe drug laws.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>What is your vision for OU SSDP? Where do you see your chapter in a year? in 4 or 5 years?</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">I hope to see the chapter firmly established on campus with a core group of a couple dozen activists plus many more regular attendees. I’d also like to see us hosting several big campus events that draw crowds of at least a hundred people.</p>
