Our presence in the desert southwest continues to grow with the addition of our second chapter at Arizona State University, <a href="http://ssdp.org/chapters/southwest/arizona/arizona-state-university-downtown/" target="_blank">ASU Downtown</a>. Our chapter on the main ASU campus in Tempe has been around for several years and helped collaborate with students on the Phoenix (downtown) campus to form this second ASU SSDP chapter.

The downtown campus chapter is led by California native, Daniel Perle, who is interested in reforming Arizona&#8217;s drug laws while he is a resident there. He is currently studying journalismÂ at ASU and hopes to contribute some content to the SSDP blog in addition to building a new SSDP chapter.
