There have never been this many states considering legalizing marijuana for adult or medical use at one time. <strong>But there have never been as many young people engaged in ending the drug war as there are now</strong>, and SSDP has never been better equipped to harness their unique power. We hope you&#8217;ll take a few minutes this morning to read all about it in our <a href="http://ssdp.org/assets/SSDP-2016-annual-report.pdf">2015-16 annual report</a>, including highlights like these:
<ul>
	<li>presence on more than 320 campuses (from 284 the previous year);</li>
	<li>protesting UN drug policy in advance of UNGASS with 150 participants;</li>
	<li>creation of the Just Say Know peer-to-peer drug education program, a groundbreaking approach to on-campus drug education based in truth, science, and harm reduction principles; and</li>
	<li>roll out of the Chapter Activity Tracker, our web-based tool to power student advocacy, organizing, and education.</li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr">The global consensus on drug prohibition is unraveling, and we are poised to deal a significant blow to the drug war if the reform initiatives on the ballot this November achieve victory. But we can’t do it without you. Spend a few hours in the next 10 days <a href="http://legalize2016.org">calling through our phonebank</a> or <a href="http://ssdp.org/donate">make a gift today</a> to support the people who do.</p>
The world is watching, and the progress we make in the United States toward ending drug prohibition will prove that there is a better approach to drug policy. These reforms will be won through the power of democracy and the kind of powerful grassroots organizing we do at SSDP.
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Your donation will directly support our student members’ efforts to build a safer and more just future &#8212; to start making sense.</strong></p>
<a href="http://ssdp.org/donate"><strong>Are you with them?</strong></a>
