One of the best parts about my job is getting to see firsthand how the SSDP network grows. Working with Geirrod Stark of the College of Western Idaho is a prime example of that process, because he has started the second ever chapter of SSDP in Idaho, doubling our presence there and increasing the ability for our students to work across the state to make policy change. The SSDP chapter at the College of Western Idaho has recently become established, and I&#8217;d like to share their background, accomplishments, and plans with you. Check it out!

<strong>How did you hear about SSDP?</strong>

I heard about SSDP through the Marijuana Policy Project in Boise, Id.

<strong>Why did you want to get involved/what made you decide to start a chapter?</strong>

To raise the awareness of the new medical marijuana petition in Idaho to help legalize medical marijuana in Idaho. To help properly educate people of the real benefits of marijuana to put the prohibition of marijuana to an end.

<strong>What has the reception been like on campus? From students, teachers, administration, etc.</strong>

My teachers are excited about it and have hopes for the club to succeed.

<strong>What are some of the things you have planned or want to plan for next semester?</strong>

To help foster debates and to have more members to help.

<strong>What is the most challenging part of your experience starting/running the chapter so far?</strong>

Waiting to formally get approved by the school and having to wait for the actual approval so we can go ahead and start planning.

<strong>What is the most rewarding part?</strong>

Knowing at the end of the day that were making a change for the better for future members students and community.

<strong>What are you most excited about for your chapter/school/state/region/ssdp/drug policy right now?</strong>

That there is an active petition we can use to help our cause.

<strong>What is your vision for SSDP at the College of Western Idaho? Where do you see your chapter in a </strong><strong>year? In 4 or 5 years?</strong>

To hopefully keep growing and achieving real policy change. To have many members that are well educated and motivated to properly educate other students about the unnecessary prohibition on drugs and to consider positive benefits to ending the war on drugs.
