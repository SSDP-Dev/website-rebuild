<strong>We apologize for the lack of large sizes. We will make sure to get a bunch of XXL&#8217;s on our next order, so we should have them in a few months.</strong>



You asked, and we listened&#8230;

Our members loved our old DARE parody t-shirts, so much that we sold out last year!



But yesterday, we got new versions of this SSDP favorite, and they&#8217;re now available in <a href="http://ssdp.org/store">the SSDP store.</a>



These incorporate a slight redesign and are printed on 100% pre-shrunk cotton. The text reads: &#8220;DARE to resist the war on drugs&#8221; above &#8220;Students for Sensible Drug Policy&#8221; and &#8220;SchoolsNotPrisons.com&#8221;.



<strong><a href="http://ssdp.org/store">By purchasing one of these shirts for $15.00</a>, you&#8217;ll be supporting the important work that our students do to end the war on drugs. </strong>

Whether you want to order some of these to sell as a fundraiser for your SSDP chapter, represent yourself as a member of the &#8220;DARE generation&#8221;, or just want to spread the message of sensible drug policies, these shirts are sure to start some interesting conversations.



And good news ladies &#8212; this time we have both <a href="http://ssdp.org/assets/2012/07/justin-body-new-dare-tshirt.jpg">men&#8217;s</a> and <a href="http://ssdp.org/?attachment_id=4805">women&#8217;s</a> styles available!



We only have fewer than 150 of these on hand, so get yours before they&#8217;re gone.



<strong><a href="http://ssdp.org/store">Head on over to the SSDP store to get your shirt today.</a></strong>
