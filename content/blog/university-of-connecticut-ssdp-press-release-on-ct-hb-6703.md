&nbsp;

Hartford, CT — House Bill 6703, which would legalize marijuana in the state of Connecticut, was recently introduced to the state’s legislature by Representative Candelaria of the 95th District.

As an organization dedicated to ending the failed “War on Drugs”, UConn Students for Sensible Drug Policy is in full support of House Bill 6703, and is calling on members of the Connecticut General Assembly to vote in favor of the bill. Legalizing marijuana in Connecticut would be a first step in ending the racial, economic, and civil rights injustices of drug prohibition.

Chair of UConn SSDP’s Legislative Affairs Committee, Nadia Balkaran, says that “Marijuana prohibition is a fruitless effort which has clearly fallen short of accomplishing its goals. It&#8217;s time to start pursuing a more realistic approach regarding marijuana laws.”
