With Gov. Chris Christie’s approval ratings <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748704881304576094262124826284.html">teetering</a>, and talk of a potential presidential run in 2012, one would think the last thing he would want to do is exacerbate any issue that polls well with his constituency.  But when it comes to the overwhelmingly popular topic of medical marijuana, Gov. Christie has yet to see the forest full of trees.

With <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/m/story?id=9586503">81 percent of Americans now in favor of medical marijuana</a>, Christie finds himself fighting an uphill battle against common sense and compassion.  And state legislators find themselves at an impasse with the program, thanks in part to the governor and his desire to make the program overly restrictive.  New Jersey’s medical marijuana law is currently the most restrictive in the nation, and a year behind schedule.

Gov. Christie has created a stalemate that is <a href="http://www.nj.com/news/index.ssf/2011/01/senate_moves_towards_dissolvin.html">angering advocates, politicians and patients alike</a>.  And with 2012 right around the corner, maybe now is not such a great time to blatantly ignore your supporters and press on with a personal agenda based on failed, prohibitionist policies.
