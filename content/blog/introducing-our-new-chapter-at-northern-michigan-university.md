Our SSDP chapter at Northern Michigan University was recently recognized on campus! We&#8217;re excited to welcome them all to the family, and have prepared some information about them through an interview with Chapter Leader Perry Boyd. Check it out!

<strong>How did you hear about SSDP?</strong>

I first heard about SSDP during our first YAP club meeting this semester. Zach had mentioned the “just say know” slogan and then pulled up the SSDP page.

<strong>Why did you want to get involved/what made you decide to start a chapter?</strong>

After further looking into the organization, it seemed to be everything that I stood for and wanted to be a part of on campus. Before finding SSDP, our club sought out to only educate Michigan residents on cannabis legalization issues and I thought that was too vague. I would like to be a part of something that focuses on the whole drug war in itself and what we can do to fight back as a country.

<strong>What has the reception been like on campus? From students, teachers, administration, etc.</strong>

Students seem excited to have something like this as an option for a serious activity on campus.

<strong>What are some of the things you have planned or want to plan for next semester?</strong>

We have planned to set up on campus with an informative poster board about the club and pass out some handouts from the website. We would like to set up a voter registration table before the election in the fall, and would also love to plan some interactive activities to get the whole campus community involved with us. My dream would be to prepare a 5k around campus, either in honor of those imprisoned due to the drug war or to benefit further research of drugs with medicinal value.

<strong>What is the most challenging part of your experience starting/running the chapter so far?</strong>

The most challenging part of starting a chapter has been finding students as committed and passionate about SSDP’s cause. Since drug legalization still remains largely a taboo topic, it is challenging to find students who are willing to be open and committed to this cause.

<strong>What is the most rewarding part?</strong>

The most rewarding part of being in this organization is knowing that I’m getting involved with something I feel very passionately about.

<strong>What are you most excited about for your chapter/school/state/region/ssdp/drug policy right now?</strong>

I am most excited to set up a voter registration table and get young voters excited about voting this election season. This fall, adult-use cannabis will be on the ballots for Michigan! This could be a huge step for us economically, but also one step closer to ending the drug war.

<strong>What is your vision for NMU SSDP? Where do you see your chapter in a year? in 4 or 5 years?</strong>
My vision for NMU SSDP is to cultivate and develop a well-known group of diverse students going above and beyond with their actions to end the drug war.
