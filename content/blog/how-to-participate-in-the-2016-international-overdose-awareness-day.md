<span style="font-weight: 400;">International Overdose Awareness Day (IOAD) is a global event held on August 31st each year and aims to raise awareness of overdose and reduce the stigma of a drug-related death. It also acknowledges the grief felt by families and friends remembering those who have met with death or permanent injury as a result of drug overdose. IOAD spreads the message that the tragedy of overdose death is preventable. Read on to find out how you and your SSDP chapter can get involved with the 2016 International Overdose Awareness Day.</span>
<h1><span style="font-weight: 400;">About International Overdose Awareness Day<a href="/assets/International-Overdose-Awareness-Day-Vertical-CMYK.jpg"><img class="wp-image-19506 alignleft" src="http://ssdp.org/assets/International-Overdose-Awareness-Day-Vertical-CMYK-300x175.jpg" alt="Print" width="375" height="219" /></a></span></h1>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The first International Overdose Awareness Day was organized in 2001 by two harm reduction advocates in Melbourne, Australia. They organized a local event and give silver ribbons out for anyone who wished to commemorate a friend, partner or family member who had passed away. Any member of the community, even if not directly affected, could wear a ribbon to offer their condolences to those who had suffered an overdose.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Since then, hundreds of other NGOs and human rights organizations have become involved in International Overdose Awareness Day. Though every participant approaches the day in their own way, the campaign is centered around the following goals:</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">To provide an opportunity for people to publicly mourn for loved ones, some for the first time, without feeling guilt or shame.</span>
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">To include the greatest number of people in Overdose Awareness Day events, and encourage non-denominational involvement.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">To give community members information about the issue of fatal and nonfatal overdose.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">To send a strong message to current and former drug users that they are valued.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">To stimulate discussion about overdose prevention and drug policy.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">To provide basic information on the range of support services that exists in the local community.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">To prevent and reduce drug-related harm by supporting evidence-based policy and practice.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">To remind all of the risks of overdose.</span></li>
</ul>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Last year, SSDP participated by </span><a href="http://ssdp.org/news/blog/ssdp-recognizes-international-overdose-awareness-day/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">sharing stories of students who have been personally affected by overdose</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. This year, we are hoping to do even more. </span>
