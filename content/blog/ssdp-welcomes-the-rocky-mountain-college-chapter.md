The Mountain Region keeps getting bigger, and I love it! Molly Davis recently started a chapter at <a href="http://ssdp.org/chapters/mountain/montana/rocky-mountain-college/" target="_blank">Rocky Mountain College</a>, and has already got a sizable team on her side working to end the drug war on their campus. Read what she has to say about her experience so far.

<b>How did you hear about SSDP? </b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">I heard about SSDP through Amplify at Summer Camp Music Festival in Illinois the summer of 2014.  I saw the booth again at Electric Forest 2014 and 2015 and loved the organization and what they stood for.</span>

<b>Why did you want to get involved/what made you decide to start a chapter?</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">As a political science major, SSDP was something that coincided with my major.  I thought it would be a good opportunity to get some leadership experience while standing up for a cause I feel strongly about.  My campus had no prior established club like this, so I thought it would be a solid addition to the clubs and activities offered on campus here at Rocky.  </span>

<b>What has the reception been like on campus? From students, teachers, administration, etc.</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Students seem to be pretty supportive of what they know so far, I think it’s the teachers who are a bit more skeptical.  Luckily, we have the support of our Political Science Faculty Advisor, Dr.O’Gara as our club faculty advisor, so that’s been a huge help in the development of the club. </span>

<b>What are some of the things you have planned or want to plan for next semester?</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">After meeting with the club members a few times this semester, we have determined that we want to put on a small educational program on campus about drug use and the positive and negative effects about drugs. We also will strive to change our campus zero tolerance drug policy.  A third goal we have for this semester is to bring drug education, led by our club members, into the classrooms of local high schools so that students will have an unbiased way to learn about drugs and their harms and benefits from a more relatable source.</span>

<b>What is the most challenging part of your experience starting/running the chapter so far? </b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The most challenging part of starting the chapter is finding a time when students are free to come to the meetings and getting more people to attend.   </span>

<b>What is the most rewarding part?</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The most rewarding part of starting a club is being able to educate my peers on pressing issues surrounding drugs such as how the drug war is failing.  The more people we have who understand and have knowledge on these type of issues the more progressive change will take place.  </span>

<b>What are you most excited about for your chapter/school/state/region/ssdp/drug policy right now?</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">I am most excited for our chapter to be able to educate our own peers at Rocky, as well as local high school students in Billings.  There’s so much information that these students need to be informed about that we have the power to share.  I am also excited to see how SSDP can reform policy all over the US for a more sensible drug policies nationwide.</span>

<b>What is your vision for Rocky Mountain College SSDP? Where do you see your chapter in a year? in 4 or 5 years?</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">I would like Rocky Mountain College SSDP to grow in size and impact.  Not only do I want more students to join but I would like for our educational impact to be accepted on campus by our peers and staff.  In the next year I hope we have a solid group established with connections in the local schools so that drug education programs can be regularly conducted within the high school classrooms.  We also hope to work with different organizations in Billings to decriminalize marijuana in the city.  Nationally, we would like to take part in the SSDP conferences on a regular basis, and hope to have the opportunity to take part in more national campaigns as we develop further down the road.</span>
