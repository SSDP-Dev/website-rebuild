<p dir="ltr" id="docs-internal-guid-2fd0f832-fd17-f263-8e24-cf90fc0698ca">The new year is just around the corner, and SSDP will be designing new T-shirts for our students, supporters, and alumni for 2014. But we need your help! We are looking to our grassroots network of supporters to help us design our next T-shirt!</p>

<p dir="ltr">We’ll be collecting suggestions and designs from our supporters from now until the end of 2013 for our next SSDP T-shirt. If we like your design, we’ll make it into our next T-shirt. In addition, we&#8217;ll feature it prominently on our website, blog, and webstore, and highlight you and your design when we release the T-shirt early next year. Plus, hundreds of drug policy reformers and supporters will be sporting your design for the new year. 2014 is sure to be a historic year for drug policy reform, and we need the T-shirts to match!</p>

<p dir="ltr">To submit your T-shirt design or if you have any questions, please email SSDP’s Outreach Director, Devon Tackels, with your text, graphic, or suggestion at <a href="mailto:devon@ssdp.org">devon@ssdp.org</a> by January 6th, 2014. You can take a look at some of our previous shirt designs <a href="https://org.salsalabs.com/o/1259/t/13106/shop/shop.jsp?storefront_KEY=870">here. </a></p>

We’re excited to see what our supporters have in mind for our next design, and look forward to your submissions. Stay Sensible!
