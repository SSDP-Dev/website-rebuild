In short &#8211; we won the battle. Rep. Mark Souder withdrew his amendment to bar financial aid from students with drug possession convictions. He said &#8221; I was probably going to lose today.&#8221;

This war ain&#8217;t over though. A compromise to the amendment will be made in conference committee and it is expected that students convicted of felony drug crimes will still be unable to get aid for college. Still, this is a huge victory for us and we can expect significantly less students to be forced to drop out of school because a man from Indiana thinks they should be punished twice for the same crime.
<blockquote>You rock SSDP. You did this. It was your calls to congress. Your grassroots action. Your dedication to this organization and its mission for a fair and sensible drug policy. Look around on your campus. How many other student groups have been able to change federal law?</blockquote>
