A magnitude 7.1 earthquake rocked central Mexico back in September. Happily, none of the members of the SSDP chapter in Mexico, known as Estudiantes por una Política Sensata de Drogas (EPSD) México, were physically harmed by the earthquake. However, the building which housed the EPSD office was among those that collapsed, leaving our family down there without a base of operations to conduct their crucial work to reform drug policies in México. 

We reached out to supporters like you to ask for funds to help rebuild their base of operations. We are happy to report that your generosity helped us raise thousands of dollars (US) and construction is underway. Watch this space for future updates on their progress! 

Here a few photos of the new office space being constructed and renovated. They still have a long way to go. But thanks to you, our amazing and supportive network, they are on the way back to normalcy.
