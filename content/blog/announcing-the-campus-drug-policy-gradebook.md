<strong>SSDP is proud to present its <a href="http://ssdp.org/school-policies/">Campus Drug Policy Gradebook</a>!</strong>



SSDP analyzed the drug and alcohol policies of the <a href="http://www.forbes.com/top-colleges/list/" target="_blank">top 300 U.S. schools according to Forbes Magazine</a>. From this analysis, SSDP created the Gradebook, a resource which provides both a grade for each school and recommendations for improvement.



<b>How Schools Are Graded</b>



Campus drug policies were evaluated according to several factors. Each school started with an average C grade. Positive policy aspects—clearly defined sanctions for specific violations, sanctions focusing on treatment and education, and <a title="Call 911 Good Samaritan" href="http://ssdp.org/campaigns/call-911-good-samaritan-policies/">medical amnesty or Good Samaritan</a> policies—improve the school’s grade. Negative factors—zero tolerance policies, sanctions focusing on punishment, and reliance on referrals to law enforcement—warrant lower grades.



An ideal alcohol and drug policy applies sanctions, focused on education and treatment, based on the number and severity of a student’s infractions and includes a full medical amnesty policy.



<b>Using the Gradebook</b>



The Gradebook is a resource for students. The grading system can be used not only to help students learn about the alcohol and drug policies at their schools, but to let students compare their school’s drug policies to ideal and inferior policies. In addition, the recommendations for improvement can help students identify and work to change problematic policies on campus.
