Many of you may know Dr. Friedman as the Nobel Prize winning economic analyst and outspoken proponent of the economic benefits of drug legalization. You also may recall that in 2005, <a href="http://www.forbes.com/2005/06/02/cz_qh_0602pot.html" target="_blank">he lead a list of over 500 U.S. economists</a> who supported a <a href="http://www.cato.org/publications/white-paper/budgetary-impact-ending-drug-prohibition" target="_blank">Harvard University report</a> on the failed economic policies of marijuana legalization, and <a href="http://drugwarchronicles.blogspot.com/2008/08/mpp-tv-profiles-in-marijuana-reform.html" target="_blank">continued to speak out against the drug war</a> leading up to his death in 2006. Here is what Dr. Friedman had to say about the the benefits America would see by ending the drug war:

<blockquote>“I see America with half the number of prisons, half the number of prisoners, ten thousand fewer homicides a year, inner cities in which there&#8217;s a chance for these poor people to live without being afraid for their lives, citizens who might be respectable who are now addicts not being subject to becoming criminals in order to get their drug, being able to get drugs for which they&#8217;re sure of the quality. You know, the same thing happened under prohibition of alcohol as is happening now. Under prohibition of alcohol, deaths from alcohol poisoning, from poisoning by things that were mixed in with the bootleg alcohol, went up sharply. Similarly, under drug prohibition, deaths from overdose, from adulterations, from adulterated substances have gone up.”</blockquote>

Milton Friedman’s Century is an excellent way to stimulate the conversation about drug policy reform on your campus. If you are interested, contact your <a href="http://ssdp.org/chapters/regions">regional SSDP staff member</a> to learn how you can get involved in this project, and host an event on your campus today.
