Our newest official chapter is at <a title="Lone Star Kingwood SSDP" href="http://ssdp.org/chapters/southern/texas/lone-star-college-kingwood/">Lone Star College Kingwood</a>! Based in Kingwood, Texas, this is our third chapter in the Lone Star State. Below is my interview with chapter founder and leader Brendan Lane:



&nbsp;



<strong>How did you hear about SSDP?</strong>



I heard about SSDP through the Multi-Disciplinary Association of Psychedelic Studies (MAPS). They’re doing amazing work and I can’t stress enough how important that work is. They’re on the frontier of psychiatry and hopefully the world will understand that one day.



<strong>Why did you want to get involved/what made you decide to start a chapter?</strong>



The drug war has affected me personally on a fundamental level, and upon learning more of the atrocities the drug war has created in our society I felt personally responsible to organize and inform others so that we may impact policy in a positive manner.

&nbsp;



<strong>What has the reception been like so far?</strong>



So far, absolutely positive. My professors have all been receptive to the chapter and have been helping me out immensely. I believe there are many interested students which we haven’t reached yet, but we’re definitely doing our best to change that.



<strong>What are some of the things you have planned or want to plan for next semester?</strong>



In this semester I’d like to establish a member base which would give the chapter the strength it needs to lobby, and in the near future organize lobbying events so that we may inform our legislature that this is something their constituency cares about.



<strong>What has been the most challenging part of your experience starting/running the chapter so far?</strong>



Since we’ve been up and running for five days now, finding ways to reach out to people. I don’t think that will be an issue in the days soon to come though.



<strong>What has been the most rewarding part?</strong>



Networking with like-minded people about issues that truly matter and affect our society deeply. Before I started this chapter I had no idea how many people would be willing to drop what they’re doing and help me out. It has been a truly eye-opening experience to see how much people really care.



<strong>What are you most excited about for your chapter right now?</strong>



I’m excited to get people interested, informed, and involved!



<strong>What is your vision for Kingwood SSDP? Where do you see your chapter in a year? in 4 or 5 years?</strong>



My main goal is to educate people. I’d like to give the members the tools necessary so that they may be successful on their own in lobbying legislature whether it’s about the drug war or not. Political participation is a key element of being a citizen in any country and our education system doesn’t instruct people how to do it effectively. I hope that in many years to come, when I have left, someone will take up the torch and continue the organization with the same spirit.
