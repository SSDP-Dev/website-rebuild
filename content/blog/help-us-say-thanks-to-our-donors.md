Last year, we asked our supporters who were not able to make a financial contribution to Students for Sensible Drug Policy to <a href="http://ssdp.org/giving-thanks-to-our-donors/">write quick thank you messages</a> to those who were able to donate. Your responses were so powerful that we decided to do it again this year.



This Thanksgiving, we&#8217;re hoping you can help us express our thanks to our donors. We think they will really appreciate hearing from people like you who are a part of SSDP but for whatever reason, are unable to contribute financially to our work.  Your responses will be compiled in a document to be shared with our Sensible Supporters, Sustainers, Sponsors, and Superstars (these are people who support our work with monthly donations through our <a href="http://ssdp.org/become-a-member">Sensible Membership program</a>) and with those who have donated more than $200 in the last year. You may choose to submit your message anonymously if you wish.



Perhaps SSDP has provided you with an experience, skill, resource, opportunity to take action, training material, promotional materials, advice, research, networking connection, leadership opportunity, a source of inspiration, or maybe we have touched your life in another way. Without the financial support provided by our donors, none of this would have been possible. <a href="http://ssdp.org/giving-thanks-to-our-donors/">Please consider helping us thank them.</a>



As you know, there are only a few more days before Thanksgiving, so take a moment to submit your thank you message today.
