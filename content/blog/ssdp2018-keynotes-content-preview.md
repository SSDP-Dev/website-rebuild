<h4>DARE Plenary: Lived Experiences</h4>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Creating sensible drug policy is most effective when we listen to the communities that are directly impacted by policy. This plenary brings together students and alumni of SSDP who have been personally affected by the War on Drugs to talk about their experiences, and how the movement can advocate with and for them in a way that puts people with lived experience first!</span>
<h4>SSDP Student Congress</h4>
In line with our values of democracy, transparency, and accountability, <a href="https://ssdp.org/blog/ssdp-congress-2018-call-student-directors-chapter-resolutions/">SSDP Congress</a> convenes annually to give each chapter in the network the opportunity to elect new student members to the Board of Directors and to vote on resolutions for the organization.
<h4>Lobby Day</h4>
On Monday 3/5, hundreds of students, alumni and supporters will travel by bus to Washington, DC where we will meet with our elected officials to advocate for sensible drug policies. More details coming soon.
