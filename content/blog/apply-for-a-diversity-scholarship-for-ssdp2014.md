In an ongoing effort to diversify SSDP’s student network and ensure that a diverse group of individuals and viewpoints are represented at our upcoming international conference, our Outreach, Recruitment, Diversity committee (ORD) is <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1jvZVq46N-r_JxQJYG7Y56NZtHwSlbvKgVwzgLdSumTs/viewform" target="_blank">offering scholarships</a> to help defray the cost of attending the conference. The ORD scholarships are in addition to the <a href="https://docs.google.com/a/ssdp.org/forms/d/11PxmNfTCevYYUeZZ7Mv8un8PVaTW8Ws2eEL8GhdO8NI/viewform" target="_blank">general scholarship</a> funds that SSDP has made available for students this year.<em> If you have already applied for a conference scholarship, you do NOT need to apply for the diversity scholarship.</em>

&nbsp;

<b>What is the Outreach, Recruitment, and Diversity Committee (ORD)?</b>

ORD is a collaborative committee currently headed by SSDP Board member Kat Murti. It also includes students, alumni, and community members dedicated to broadening Students for Sensible Drug Policy’s base. Since its founding in March 2011, ORD has taken on the challenges of strengthening diversity in all its forms within SSDP. The committee endeavors to ensure that the range of perspectives and personal experiences of all communities and individuals negatively impacted in the War on Drugs are represented and integrated into SSDP and the drug policy reform movement at large. ORD does this by creating a welcoming, open, and safe space for all stakeholders.

&nbsp;

<b>Who can apply for an ORD scholarship?</b>

The short answer is: <b>ANYONE can apply!!</b>  Do you self-identify with a group that is generally under-represented at SSDP events and conferences? Perhaps your race, gender, sexual orientation, or age means that you lie outside of the range of demographics that are typical of SSDP conferences. Perhaps you are a returning student, a veteran, a parent or an immigrant. Maybe you are the only SSDP chapter leader in your state. Or perhaps nobody from your chapter has ever attended an SSDP conference.

&nbsp;

<strong>Here is how the ORD committee defines “diversity” on its <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/198658483498623/">facebook page</a>:</strong>

Age, Background, Class or Socioeconomic Identification, Culture &amp; Traditions, Current Student or Non-Student Status, Disability or Differently-Abled Status, Diversity of Opinion, Employment Status, Ethnicity, Gender Identification, Ideology, Language, Mental Health, Moral Framework, Nationality, Physical Health, Political Affiliation, Pregnancy &amp; Parenting Status (pregnant women, custodial and noncustodial parents, foster &amp; adoptive parents, legal guardians, etc), Primary Movement of Identification (formerly incarcerated, recovery, student, etc.), Race, Relationship Orientation &amp; Status, Relationship With Drugs/How One Self-Identifies in Relation to Drugs (user, non drug user, addict, recreational user, medical user, abstainer, in recovery, etc.), Religion, Sexual Identification, Stake in Reform, Subculture, and any other self-identifiers.*

If any of these categories describe you, or you simply can not afford to attend conference without additional financial support, this scholarship may be for you! Apply today! <b>The deadline to apply is July 25th, 2014!!</b>
