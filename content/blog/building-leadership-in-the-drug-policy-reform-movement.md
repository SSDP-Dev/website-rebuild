On the weekend of Friday the 20th to Sunday the 22nd of April, <a title="UK Students for Sensible Drug Policy " href="http://www.ssdp.org.uk/">Students for Sensible Drug Policy UK</a> will be hosting its third annual conference at the School of Oriental and African Studies in London.



This year’s conference is about building on the re-invigoration of grassroots involvement in the drug policy reform movement and ensuring all who wish to be effective activists are equipped with the skills they need to make change possible.



SSDP UK is teaming up with a number of other networks, including LEAP Europe, National Users Network, UK Cannabis Social Clubs and the University of Kent at Canterbury Psychedelics Society (which holds its own conference in May) to make this conference their biggest yet!



Highlighted events include a panel discussion with Damon Barrett of Harm Reduction International, Steve Rolles from the Transform Drug Policy Foundation and journalist, Johann Hari.  It is great to see that diverse topics will be addressed during the parallel sessions, including how psychedelics work in the brain, the economics of prohibition and a meditation and mindfulness workshop.



SSDP Board member, Graham de Barra will be attending, along with David Hewson from Canadian Students for Sensible Drug Policy and we look forward to hearing from them about the whole experience.  For those of you who have friends in Europe who might be interested in starting an SSDP chapter, this is a great opportunity to learn from each other and share experiences.



SSDP UK has been focused on leadership development for anyone who wants to become a better activist and not just students and youth—kudos for being inclusive!  We are sure you will have an amazing conference and we wish we could be there with you.  Cheers to growing the movement and becoming stronger day by day!
