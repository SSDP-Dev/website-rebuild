<span style="font-weight: 400;">Two days ago, the</span><a href="http://www.contrarepresionmex.org/english"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Caravan Against Repression in Mexico</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> arrived in Boston to begin their month long journey through the US. The Caravan will be traveling through 18 different cities, including a stop in Chicago this weekend to speak at the <a href="http://ezevent.com/Live/2016SSDPMidwestRegionalConference/10212016/708431">SSDP Midwest Regional Conference</a>.</span>

<a href="/assets/Caravan-Route.jpg"><img class="wp-image-20288 size-medium alignleft" src="http://ssdp.org/assets/Caravan-Route-232x300.jpg" alt="caravan-route" width="232" height="300" /></a>
<p class="alignnone">The “War on Drugs”, fabricated in the US to criminalize substances used by people the government sought to marginalize, imprison, kill, and profit from, has also been exported internationally through US foreign policy. American projects such as Plan Colombia, the Mérida Initiative, the Central American Regional Security Initiative, and the Caribbean Basin Security Initiative have sent money, weapons, military equipment and training across Latin America in an alleged attempt to stop the flow and trafficking of drugs to the world’s largest consumer base, the United States. In 2006, Felipe Calderón, then president of Mexico, served the interests of the goliath to the north by replicating US policy in his own declaration of a “War on drugs” in Mexico. Not only has drug production and trafficking increased despite President Calderon&#8217;s efforts, more violent and powerful cartels formed while the government sensationalized the capture of a few high-profile leaders. Through all of this, the people of Mexico and the rest of Latin America have suffered from an increase in human rights violations.</p>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The members of the Caravan have come in opposition to the US-funded militarization of Mexico, officially known as the Mérida Initiative, and to represent their communities in the fight against repression, disappearances, and impunity of Mexican authorities.</span>

<h3>Support the Caravan With a Donation</h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The price of this caravan is approximately $20,000 dollars. This includes expenses for passports, visas, plane tickets, land transportation, and countless other small expenses. While the caravan is an effort of political, rather than economic, solidarity, we believe that the Mexican organizations participating in this tour should obtain some financial support for their struggle</span>
