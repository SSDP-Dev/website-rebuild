First, <a href="http://www.hempfest.org/drupal/node/69">Seattle Hempfest congratulates him</a> for his new title and commends him for being one of “Seattle’s finest”.

Then, he calls for an <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB124225891527617397.html">end to the “war on drugs&#8221;</a>.

And for a couple of months, he manages to <a href="http://stopthedrugwar.com/chronicle_blog/2009/jun/15/drug_czar_gets_humiliated_in_rol">remain completely silent about drugs</a>, using the excuse that he&#8217;s still finding his way around the office.

But finally, last week, Drug Czar Gil Kerlikowske shocks the nation during a speech in California, stating that,
<blockquote>Marijuana is dangerous and has no medicinal benefit <a href="http://www.fresnobee.com/local/story/1553061.html">[The Fresno Bee]</a></blockquote>
Seriously. Even after the Obama administration <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/19/us/19holder.html">promised to stop raids on medical marijuana dispensaries</a>, Kerlikowske manages to somehow convince himself that it’s a good idea to tell hundreds of Californians that medical marijuana is bullshit. So much for the “science based approach to drug policy rather than the scorched earth policies of the previous administration” Seattle Hempfest claimed Kerlikowske so obviously respected.

If you’re as outraged as I am, please take a second to <a href="https://secure2.convio.net/mpp/site/Advocacy?cmd=display&amp;page=UserAction&amp;id=358">fill out this form</a> to send an e-mail to President Obama about Kerlikowske’s statement. We can&#8217;t just let such appalling and offensive lies slide unnoticed.
