<h2><b>IMMIGRATION AND THE WAR ON DRUGS</b></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Simple drug use or possession, particularly of marijuana, is one of the most common reasons that people are criminalized in the United States. In some cases, individuals with drug charges are even </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/mar/28/immigration-drug-sentencing-laws-prison-junior-francisco"><span style="font-weight: 400;">asked to leave</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the United States. This is how the War on Drugs disenfranchises immigrants. </span>

<a href="https://www.nacdl.org/uploadedFiles/Content/Legal_Education/Live_CLE/Live_CLE/03_Drug_Offenses_Handout.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Drug laws</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> passed in the 1980s and 1990s state that possessions of drugs or drug paraphernalia are automatically “aggravated felonies,” which are deportable offenses, even for lawful permanent residents. In these cases, drug offenses are treated more harshly than assault or fraud. Like other drug sentencing laws, judges are prohibited from considering potentially mitigating factors, such as the immigrant’s personal life or the extenuating circumstances they were facing at the time, and must deliver a sentence of mandatory deportation.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Unlike other drug offenders, when immigrants have finished serving the time from their drug sentences, instead of being allowed to walk free, they are transferred to </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/mar/28/immigration-drug-sentencing-laws-prison-junior-francisco"><span style="font-weight: 400;">immigrant detention facilities</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, where they are held before they are deported. Individuals who have become legal permanent residents can have their statuses revoked after </span><a href="http://www.vice.com/read/how-a-20-year-policy-is-still-criminalizing-immigrants-today"><span style="font-weight: 400;">drug convictions</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, making them ineligible to ever be allowed to legally return to the United States.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">According to a report by </span><a href="https://www.hrw.org/report/2015/06/16/price-too-high/us-families-torn-apart-deportations-drug-offenses"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Human Rights Watch</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, approximately 260,000 people were deported after nonviolent drug convictions between 2007 and 2012, making up about 10 percent of the total number kicked out of the country. During this time, “deportations of people convicted of drug possession </span><a href="http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2016/04/war-on-drugs-immigrant-deportations-obama-213792"><span style="font-weight: 400;">spiked 43 percent</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> over the same period, higher than the 31 percent increase in overall deportations.”</span>

<hr />

<h2><b>IMMIGRATION LAWS VIOLATE HUMAN RIGHTS</b></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Migration is a human right. Throughout history, immigrants have come to the U.S. seeking refuge from war, persecution, and poverty. When they come here, they suffer from the effects of marginalization and oppression that face many other poor communities of color in the U.S, including failing schools, racial profiling, and mass incarceration.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">In Students for Sensible Drug Policy, we talk about the school-to-prison pipeline, which describes the punitive treatment of youth in schools. This culture of punishment parallels the culture of punishment that people face in the streets from law enforcement and in the criminal justice system. For young immigrants who have not yet naturalized, </span><a href="http://www.searac.org/sites/default/files/SEAA%20School%20to%20Deportation%20Pipeline_0.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;">the school-to-prison pipeline ends in deportation</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and permanent separation from family members, even after they have served their sentence. In addition, many orders of deportation are </span><a href="http://www.searac.org/sites/default/files/18877%20AAPIs%20Behind%20Bars_web.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;">based on old criminal records</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> rather than current offenses. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Numerous human rights organizations take the position that no human being can be “illegal” or outside the protection of the law. However, the United States continues to violate human rights by permitting the abuse and discrimination of human beings based on immigration status.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">What’s even more startling is that immigrants don’t need to be convicted of an offense to get caught up in the prison-to-deportation pipeline. The United States immigration system is considered civil law, which does not offer the due process protections that are given to individuals in the criminal justice system.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Once in the system, Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) fails to ensure the health and safety of their detainees. A</span><a href="https://www.aclu.org/report/fatal-neglect-how-ice-ignores-death-detention"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> report</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> released by the ACLU, Detention Watch Network, and National Immigrant Justice Center titled &#8220;Fatal Neglect: How ICE Ignores Deaths in Detention” documents how ICE has not only repeatedly failed to provide sufficient medical care, but has also consistently failed to force changes in facilities that could reduce future deaths. The report details eight deaths that have happened in immigration detention facilities and offers recommendations for correcting these injustices, which include meeting healthcare needs in a timely manner, providing adequate levels of emergency staff, adequately screening individuals for illnesses, and more.</span>

<h2><b>THE WAR ON DRUGS CREATES DRUG WAR REFUGEES</b></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">In the United States, narratives about the drug problem portray drug criminals as evil people &#8211; usually people of color &#8211; who are invading America and flooding communities with drugs. What’s often left out of media reports, is the United States’ own involvement in fueling the drug problem, both domestically and internationally.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Labor Secretary Robert Reich </span><a href="http://reason.com/archives/2014/07/23/drug-war-refugees"><span style="font-weight: 400;">says</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, “If there weren&#8217;t a lot of Americans seeking marijuana and heroin and cocaine, there would not be a drug war.&#8221; America is the number one consumer of illegal drugs, and the money used to purchase illegal drugs feeds the suppliers of drugs. U.S. law enforcement officials estimate that </span><a href="http://worldblog.nbcnews.com/_news/2008/06/25/4376042-mexican-drug-war-alarming-us-officials"><span style="font-weight: 400;">$12 to $15 billion per year</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in cash flows from the United States by Mexican traffickers. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">In order to combat this problem, the United States and Mexico formed a partnership known as the Mérida Initiative, aka Plan Mexico, where the U.S. Congress appropriated $2.5 billion for Mexico to combat drug crime. However, this has actually increased the slaughter of innocent people. An </span><a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/neill-franklin/the-immigration-crisis-ju_b_5668595.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">average 11,000 to 18,000</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> civilian casualties occur each year due to the Mérida Initiative. The Mérida Initiative has also  fueled the corruption amongst Mexican politicians and the police. One of the most famous instances of these human rights violations is the disappearance of 43 students from </span><a href="http://ssdp.org/news/blog/september-monthly-mosaic-state-sponsored-repression-and-the-war-on-drugs/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ayotzinapa</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">In an effort to flee the war and poverty in their country, Mexican citizens immigrate to the United States, where they are then criminalized and punished for their presence.</span>

<div id="attachment_20926" style="width: 660px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/neill-franklin/the-immigration-crisis-ju_b_5668595.html"><img class="wp-image-20926" src="http://ssdp.org/assets/Screen-Shot-2017-01-17-at-11.42.18-AM-1024x325.png" alt="The Immigration Crisis: Just Another Byproduct of the Drug War, Neill Franklin" width="650" height="207" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">The Immigration Crisis: Just Another Byproduct of the Drug War, Neill Franklin</p></div>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Internationally, activists are </span><a href="http://www.truth-out.org/news/item/35312-activists-protest-us-role-in-mexico-s-drug-war-violence-while-candidates-remain-quiet"><span style="font-weight: 400;">calling</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for an end to Mérida Initiative and an end to the use of violence as a means of combatting the drug problem. They will continue to raise awareness about the injustices associated with the drug war.</span>

<h2><b>MARIJUANA LEGALIZATION &amp; IMMIGRATION</b></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">If the war on drugs is a war on immigrants, how will the recent marijuana legalization initiatives for adult use have an impact on these communities? The </span><a href="https://www.ilrc.org/immigrant-legal-resource-center-report-finds-proposition-64-offers-crucial-immigration-benefits"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Immigrant Legal Resource Center</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> provides a </span><a href="https://www.ilrc.org/immigration-impact-analysis-adult-use-marijuana-act"><span style="font-weight: 400;">policy analysis</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of the impact of California’s Proposition 64, also known as the Adult use of Marijuana Act, and find that the bill would help reduce the harms of the drug war.  For starters, the decriminalization of marijuana for people aged 21 and older could help some noncitizens avoid losing their lawful status. In addition, by reducing the penalties for minor marijuana offenses for young adults between the ages of 18 to 20, the bill could also reduce the number of people being barred from key forms of immigration relief. Post-conviction, Proposition 64 could also reduce the number of people subject to deportation, and open up opportunities for citizenship for individuals with past marijuana convictions.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">However, </span><a href="http://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/news/immigration/sd-me-marijuana-immigration-20161014-story.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">it is still unwise</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for immigrants to consume, possess, or distribute marijuana. Jennifer Casey, an immigration attorney in Denver, says that green-card holders who travel outside the US and want to come back could be permanently banned from returning if a Customs and Border Protection officer believes that the immigrant used marijuana, even if they reside in states where marijuana is legal. No conviction is necessary. San Diego-based immigration attorney Jan Bejar adds that immigrants should also avoid working in dispensaries. Because cannabis is still illegal at a federal level, working in the industry could be considered “helping with drug trafficking.”</span>

Until marijuana legalization occurs at a federal level, immigrants will still be labeled as criminals for participating in state-level legal marijuana markets in the United States.

<h2><b>SANCTUARY CITIES &amp; CAMPUSES</b></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">With the recent election of President-elect Donald Trump and his promise to deport millions of immigrants when he takes office, the </span><a href="https://www.ilrc.org/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Immigrant Legal Resource Center</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> has compiled a </span><a href="https://www.ilrc.org/sites/default/files/resources/local_options-20161215.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;">report</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on how cities and counties across the United States can enact policies to protect their immigrant residents. One point that they want the public to be aware of is that cities and counties are not required to help enforce federal immigration laws &#8211; many just choose to cooperate at their own expense. One of the most important things that communities can do to stop the deportation of immigrants and separation of families is to encourage their cities and counties to cease cooperation with Immigration and Customs Enforcement.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">In “</span><a href="https://www.ilrc.org/sites/default/files/resources/sanctuary_report_final_1-min.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Searching for Sanctuary</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">,” another report issued by the Immigration Legal Resource Center, an interactive map details the degree to which 2500 counties in the country has fed the jail-to-deportation pipeline.</span>

<div id="attachment_20932" style="width: 660px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="/assets/Untitled-2.png"><img class="wp-image-20932" src="https://ssdp.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Untitled-2.png" alt="Local Police Assistance with Deportations" width="650" height="489" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Local Police Assistance with Deportations</p></div>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The positioning of local law enforcement as forces to fear damages the trust that should exist between the community and the police, whose mission is to serve and protect. Consequently, immigrants who are the victims of crime or witnesses to crime whether it’s domestic violence, assault, or robbery, will refrain from participating in the justice system.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">In order to protect immigrants from local law enforcement, communities are moving to declare their cities, and counties as sanctuaries for immigrants, meaning that undocumented immigrants will not be prosecuted by their cities and counties solely for living in the country illegally. </span><a href="http://www.sfgate.com/bayarea/article/Newsom-says-S-F-won-t-help-with-raids-Mayor-2600450.php"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sanctuary cities</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> prevent the allocation of municipal funds and resources to enforce federal immigration laws and forbid the police or city employees to ask about a person’s immigration status.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Many students, including SSDP members at Texas A&amp;M University, Columbia University, and Brown University, are pursuing campaigns to make their campuses </span><a href="http://www.abajournal.com/news/article/can_universities_create_sanctuary_campuses_to_protect_immigrant_students"><span style="font-weight: 400;">sanctuary campuses</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Proposed policies on these campuses </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanctuary_campus#cite_note-:0-1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">include</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">:</span>
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Not allowing Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officers onto campus without a warrant.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The refusal of campus police to enforce immigration law.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Not sharing student immigration status with ICE.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Not gathering information on immigration or citizenship status.</span></li>
