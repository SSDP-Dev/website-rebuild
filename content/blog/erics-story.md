One of my favorite things about <a title="Donate" href="http://ssdp.org/donate/">Students for Sensible Drug Policy</a> is sharing the stories of the amazing and inspirational young people I get to work with every day. Eric is one of those young people, and I’m pleased to tell you a bit about him:

&nbsp;

<div id="attachment_14662" style="width: 210px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><a href="http://youtu.be/dlP2gdKChR8?list=PLC5VLOYYsLDFSY96zl8v6Ljv9teFScISN"><img class="wp-image-14662" src="http://ssdp.org/assets/eric-gudz-headshot1-236x300.jpg" alt="Click Eric's photo to watch him receive SSDP's Rising Star Student award." width="200" height="254" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Click Eric&#8217;s photo to watch him receive SSDP&#8217;s Rising Star Student award.</p></div>

During his deployment to Afghanistan, Eric Gudz wanted to help his fellow service members in need, so he spent the last year of his service in an Army transitional medical unit. There, his eyes were opened to the physical, mental, and physiological horrors brought on by war. Eric told us: “Upon leaving the service and concluding my short military career, I wanted to be a part of an organization that was serious about tackling the failed war on drugs, and one that wasn’t afraid to get their boots dirty either.”

&nbsp;

His SSDP chapter at the University of California Davis is now one of the most active in the Pacific region, working to reduce the harms of punitive campus policies such as financial aid sanctions and dorm eviction following drug-related incidents. Because of thier work, untold numbers students will be able to continue their college education.

&nbsp;

Eric is one of many SSDP students actively working for more sensible drug policies through their involvement with SSDP. <a title="Donate" href="http://ssdp.org/donate/">Please consider making a tax-deductible donation today so we can provide Eric and his peers with the best possible resources and support.</a>

Sensibly,
