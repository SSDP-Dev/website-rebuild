<p dir="ltr">This year attendees will have the opportunity to spend three days interacting with people committed to finding alternatives to the war on drugs while participating in sessions given by leading experts from around the world. SSDP is an exhibitor at the conference and will have several ways our students, supporters and alumni can participate in SSDP related activities throughout the entirety of the event. In addition, SSDP students, alumni, and staff will be speaking and participating in panel discussions during the event. No matter what your involvement in SSDP, or the movement to reform drug policy, there are ways to participate in the discussion through SSDP and our partner organizations.</p>

<strong>Young People Challenging the Drug War (Roundtable)</strong>

<strong>Thursday, Oct. 24, 11:30-1:00pm

</strong>Governor’s Square 14

<p dir="ltr">Young people are taking the lead on policy reform efforts for many pressing issues – especially drug policy reform – yet their contributions are often overlooked. How can young organizers make their voices heard in policy reform conversations? Too often young organizers fight for reforms that will not affect them unless they are at least 18 or 21 years old – so how does this affect young organizers? How can we include young people in the development of drug education policies? And how can youth working on related issues cross-pollinate and share strategies? (Spanish translation available.)</p>

<p dir="ltr">Facilitator: Kassandra Frederique, Policy Coordinator, Drug Policy Alliance, New York, NY</p>

<p dir="ltr">•Aram Barra, Drug Policy Program Director, Espolea Condesa, Mexico</p>
