<span style="font-weight: 400;">The interpersonal connections between SSDPers have always been the glue that makes our organization so strong. With an ever-growing population of SSDP alumni, there’s never been a better time to formalize those relationships. Today, we’re thrilled to announce the launch of <a href="http://ssdp.org/alumni/mentors/">“SSDP Mentors,” the SSDP Alumni Association Mentoring Program</a>!</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;"><img class="wp-image-19855 alignright" src="http://ssdp.org/assets/samtracy-alum-300x201.jpg" alt="SSDP Alum Sam Tracy speaking with a student" width="235" height="159" />By connecting current SSDP students with those who have graduated, we hope that students can be better prepared for life after graduation, and alumni can stay better connected to student drug policy activism, while providing mentorship and guidance to their younger peers. </span>

Currently in pilot phase, SSDP Mentors is a way for students and alumni to develop meaningful relationships that further the cause of sensible drug policy reform while aiding in students’ professional development. The goal of the program is to keep alumni connected to the current work that SSDP students are doing while simultaneously giving students an additional resource to utilize as they fight to end the drug war in their communities.
