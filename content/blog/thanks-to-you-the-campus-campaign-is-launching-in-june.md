<p style="color: #000000;">It&#8217;s late, but we wanted to let you know right away, because: WOW! The SSDP family really came through on this one. <strong>Thanks to you, a committed donor from California will be matching the first $50,000 you gave to <a href="http://ssdp.org/donate-cc">support the 2015-2016 Campus Campaign</a>!</strong></p>
<a href="http://ssdp.org/news/blog/campus-campaign/"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-15100" src="http://ssdp.org/assets/CC-by-the-numbers-1411303211.png" alt="CC by the numbers 141130" width="250" /></a>That means we&#8217;re launching our wildly successful <a href="http://ssdp.org/news/blog/campus-campaign/">Campus Campaign</a> in June when we hire the first Campus Coordinator to expand our network and get out the youth vote in key states in preparation for 2016. But that&#8217;s just the beginning: if we are able to fully fund this campaign in the next 15 months, six Campus Coordinators will be working across the nation to ensure that the reforms we&#8217;ve been fighting so hard to achieve continue to expand &#8212; bringing justice, compassion, and sensibility to more and more states through youth- and student-centered action.

Many members of our network have successfully funded the first stage of this campaign, and we couldn&#8217;t be more grateful for their commitment to sensible drug policy reform. If you want to see this program grow but weren&#8217;t able to contribute before the deadline for this match, don&#8217;t worry! We estimate that it will cost about $375,000 to have the greatest possible impact through the end of 2016. <b>You can make an investment in building a more sensible future through the Campus Campaign any time by visiting </b><a href="http://ssdp.org/donate-cc"><b>http://ssdp.org/donate-cc</b></a><b>.</b>

With our deepest thanks,

Betty, Stacia, Drew, Jake, Scott, Lauren, and the 3,000-member SSDP student network
