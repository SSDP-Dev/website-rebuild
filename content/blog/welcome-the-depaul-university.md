It&#8217;s the middle of August, and school is almost back in session, which means we are about to see another tidal wave of newly established SSDP chapters as students come back to campus. I&#8217;m happy that the first chapter I get to introduce to the network in the 2016-2017 school year is the re-established DePaul University chapter.

I met Amy after she applied to our career services program. She took on the task of restarting her school&#8217;s chapter as a way to demonstrate her skills. Over the past two months she has gone above and beyond my expectations as a new chapter leader. They finally received their recognition from the school, and Amy agreed to answer a few questions about her SSDP experience so far. Without further ado, please welcome the DePaul University SSDP chapter back to the SSDP family!
<ol>
 	<li><strong>How did you hear about SSDP?
</strong><span style="color: #000000;"><i>It was like a dream. Me, a lost freshman at the involvement fair collided with the SSDP table. It was fate. </i><strong> </strong></span></li>
 	<li><strong>Why did you want to get involved/what made you decide to start a chapter?</strong>
<span style="color: #000000;"><i>Its so simple, and SSDP gets it. We, as a country, as a world, have to educate ourselves and implement rational, compassionate policy. SSDP is the organization I dreamt about starting in highschool, a prison of dog searches and judgement. Young adults need a place to turn for reliable information about what they&#8217;re almost certain to encounter. </i></span></li>
 	<li><strong>What are some of the things you have planned or want to plan for next semester?</strong>
<span style="color: #000000;">I <i>want to become a more recognizable and reliable organization on campus. I also hope to pull off the Midwest Regional Conference (in Chicago in October!) in soaring fashion, without a hitch! </i></span></li>
 	<li><strong>What is the most challenging part of your experience starting/running the chapter so far?</strong><strong>
</strong><span style="color: #000000;"><i>Who knew organizations had so many servers and systems and browsers at DePaul&#8230;I definitely didn&#8217;t.</i></span></li>
 	<li><strong>What is the most rewarding part?</strong>
<span style="color: #000000;"><i>This is exactly what I want to be doing. </i></span></li>
 	<li><b>What are you most excited about for your region right now?
</b><span style="color: #000000;"><i>Midwest regional conference! </i></span></li>
 	<li><strong>What is your vision for DePaul SSDP? Where do you see your chapter in a year? in 4 or 5 years?
</strong><span style="color: #000000;"><i>Being a safe haven for all those kids who come out of orientation convinced that no matter which way they slice it they&#8217;re gonna get arrested. A positive presence making palpable change to the sometimes oppressive regime on the private campus of DePaul University. </i></span></li>
