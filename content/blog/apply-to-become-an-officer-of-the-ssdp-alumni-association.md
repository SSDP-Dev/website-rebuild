<span style="font-weight: 400;">Founded in 2015, the </span><a href="http://ssdp.org/alumni"><span style="font-weight: 400;">SSDP Alumni Association</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> created a formal avenue through which SSDP Alumni could interact with our students and network. Alumni Association activities include, but are not limited to: community building through independently organized events, mentorship of current SSDP students, and philanthropy efforts for the organization. Members of the Alumni Association receive special discounts and consideration for SSDP programming and events, and of course, receive a structured pathway to stay in touch with their SSDP community.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Over the past 3 years, we have experimented with several different leadership structures of the Alumni Association. We haven’t seen the results that our network deserves, so we’re trying a new approach with more specific and varied officer positions. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">These positions will be highly self-directed, and officers are expected to engage in activities proactively. </span>
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Eligibility: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">applicants must be members of the Alumni Association in good standing</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Time commitment:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> at least 1 hour per week (maximum ~5 hours per week), at least 3 weeks out of every month</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Term:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> 1 year (It’s our hope that each officer will fill their role for at least a year, but we understand that circumstances change, so if you’re no longer able to dedicate the time needed, you may resign at any time)</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>To apply:</b> <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSe6Vwk1BSyGmKDhXtSZ3Jo2RnAajpmpK6CkKNrLNnbrGqsNpQ/viewform"><span style="font-weight: 400;">submit this form</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by Friday, July 6</span></li>
