Meet Taylor Giamo, the chapter leader of SSDP at Napa Valley College. She first found out about SSDP at the Elevate Conference, and has since been making big moves on campus. She recently became the Senator of Health Occupations with Napa Valley College student government, and is planning to push for sensible drug policy and education for her peers on campus. Read on to learn more about her!

<strong>Why did you want to get involved with SSDP?</strong>

I wanted to get involved because SSDP is a great way to connect like minded and driven people to one another.

<strong>What do you hope to accomplish this year?</strong>

I hope to host a successful, informative, and interactive panel at my college. I want to be able to get across that drugs have different implications and meanings in health, social, economic, and political issues.

<strong>What challenges have you faced? How do you plan to overcome them?</strong>

I am struggling with getting things off the ground. Planning events and starting a club takes time, but I plan to delegate certain tasks and initiatives once the chapter gets more members.

<strong>What advice would you give to people who are thinking of getting involved with SSDP?     </strong>

I advise you to do it with another friend or peer who you feel shares the same passion in drug policy. Also, budget your time between school and your chapter efficiently and religiously.

<strong>A fun fact?</strong>

Fun fact, I love thrift shopping! Always finding cool stuff on a college budget
