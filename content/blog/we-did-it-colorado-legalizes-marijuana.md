We did it!



There were so many people who didn’t think it was possible. There were so many people who never thought they would see the day. But it was possible. And we did see the day. That day was Tuesday, November 6th, 2012, and drug policy will never be the same.

It’s important to mention that none of this would have been possible without the fantastic work of the <a title="Campaign to Regulate Marijuana Like Alcohol" href="http://www.regulatemarijuana.org/" target="_blank">Campaign to Regulate Marijuana Like Alcohol</a>, so we at SSDP would like to extend a heartfelt thank you to the campaign for all of their hard work!

The campaign was also able to do more than just lead though; they brought people and organizations together to work on a common goal. The Amendment 64 effort could easily be a case study on how so many people and organizations came together to form something bigger than any one organization could do on its own. SAFER, Sensible Colorado, SSDP, NORML, MPP, DPA, and countless others worked together to make this happen, and it’s important to remember that when we work together, we truly are greater than the sum of our parts.

<strong>What was Students for Sensible Drug Policy&#8217;s role in all of this?</strong>

SSDP did not merely sit on the sidelines and watch history happen; we were a part of it! Our students and volunteers made more than <a title="SSDP Phonebank" href="http://legalizecolorado.org/phonebank/leaderboard" target="_blank">17,000 phone calls</a> to Colorado voters (check out our phonebank winners <a title="Phonebank Winners" href="http://ssdp.org/news/blog/ssdp-phonebank-winners/" target="_blank">here</a>). Thank you so much for all your time and hard working making those phone calls!



Our team on the ground engaged with more than 10,000 students and young voters on 6 different Colorado college campuses. We’re proud and honored to have played a part in making history this year, and we will continue to be involved in other historic campaigns in the years to come.
