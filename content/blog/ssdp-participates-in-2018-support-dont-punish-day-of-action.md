<span style="font-weight: 400;">Yesterday, SSDP members in Nigeria, Sierra Leone, Austria, Mexico, Ireland, Liberia, Pakistan, and the United States participated in the annual </span><a href="http://supportdontpunish.org/day-of-action-2018/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Support Don’t Punish Global Day of Action</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Occurring on the same day as the United Nation’s International Day Against Drug Abuse and Illicit Trafficking, Support Don’t Punish seeks to reclaim the message of the day from prohibitionists by raising awareness of the harms being caused by the War on Drugs. The global campaign aims to promote drug policies that respect human rights and protect public health, to change laws and policies that impede access to harm reduction interventions and other evidence-based services, and to end the criminalization of people who use drugs.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Below, check out what SSDP activists did around the world for Support Don’t Punish in 2018.</span>

<h1><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sierra Leone</span></h1>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">After months of planning, SSDP Sierra Leone had what is being described by stakeholders and attendees as one of the most well-organized discussions on drug policy to ever take place in Sierra Leone. The event consisted of an educational conference and discussion made up of a mix of government officials, young people, lawyers, and people who use drugs. The opportunity to discuss drug policy issues with all stakeholders present was an amazing opportunity for the young people involved, many of whom had never talked with a government official before. Sierra Leone’s Minister of Youth Affairs was in attendance and called for the Support Don’t Punish initiative to be expanded to other areas of the country moving forward. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The Minister started off his talk by saying: &#8220;I&#8217;m happy to be here to celebrate the Support. Don&#8217;t Punish <img class=" wp-image-33994 alignright" src="https://ssdp.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/36320180_10156212142440767_3645121568540983296_n.jpg" alt="" width="413" height="232" srcset="https://ssdp.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/36320180_10156212142440767_3645121568540983296_n.jpg 960w, https://ssdp.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/36320180_10156212142440767_3645121568540983296_n-768x432.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 413px) 100vw, 413px" />Global Day of Action 2018, with SSDP Sierra Leone and all young persons in the entire country.

On the evening of June 25th, several members of SSDP Austria took to the streets and tagged Support Don’t Punish &amp; SSDP logos across the various art walls in Vienna.
