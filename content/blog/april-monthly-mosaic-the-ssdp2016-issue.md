<b>Road to UNGASS: What You Need to Know About the Special Session and Why It Matters</b>

<i><span style="font-weight: 400">Saturday, April 16  10:30am &#8211; 11:45am</span></i>

<span style="font-weight: 400">The upcoming UN General Assembly Special Session on the world drug problem has been a hot topic of conversation since the governments of Colombia, Guatemala, and Mexico called on the UN to host an international conference on drug policy ahead of the scheduled meeting in 2019. UNGASS 2016 stands out from other international debates on drug policy because of the growing consensus among member states that punitive approaches pushed by the War on Drugs have failed. This session will provide an overview of the events that led to UNGASS, its importance in the grand scheme of drug policy reform, potential outcomes, and why it should matter to anyone with an interest in drug policy.</span>

<b>Immigration Reform Isn&#8217;t the Only Latino Issue</b>

<i><span style="font-weight: 400">Saturday, April 16  10:30am &#8211; 11:45am </span></i>

<span style="font-weight: 400">National news headlines as of late have focused on immigration reform as the main Latino issue that will drive Hispanics in numbers to the polls this election cycle, but immigration reform should not be the only thing on Latino voters or politicians’ minds. Drug policy reform is very much a Latino issue and something that more Hispanic organizations should pay mind to. The Latino population, already the nation’s largest minority group, is set to transmogrify the demographic profile of the United States according to the Pew Research Center. In the same way, that marijuana arrest rates have managed to sweep thousands of people into the criminal justice system, particularly blacks in disproportionate numbers, similar arrest rates, and patterns are happening to Latino communities. The drug war is a vehicle for mass deportation.</span>

<b>DARE Special Plenary Session—Fierce Allies: Collaborating Across the Divide for Drug Policy Reform</b> <i><span style="font-weight: 400">Saturday, April 16  12:00pm &#8211; 1:15pm</span></i>

<span style="font-weight: 400">Students for Sensible Drug Policy Reform is committed to integrating and addressing broad ranging issues, from drug education to criminal and racial justice.  Doing so effectively requires us to build resilient multi-perspective collaborations and engage in fiercely honest dialogues about the very issues that divide us.  In this interactive plenary, J. Miakoda Taylor, will lead us in resourcing practices and probing inquiries that empower each of us to transform the obstacles of shame, fear, and rage into catalysts for Fierce Allyship. </span>

<b>La Guerra Contra las Drogas en América Latina</b>

<i><span style="font-weight: 400">Saturday, April 16 3:00pm &#8211; 4:15pm </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">A roundtable panel focusing on drug policy reform in Latin America, one of the regions most affected by the Global War on Drugs. SSDP students from Mexico will join activists from El Salvador and Honduras to explore the issues most affecting their home.</span>

<b>SSDP DARE Meetup </b>

<i><span style="font-weight: 400">Saturday, April 16 7:00pm &#8211; 8:00pm </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">Interested in broadening perspectives in SSDP and the drug policy reform movement? Join members of SSDP’s Diversity Awareness Reflection and Education (</span><a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/198658483498623/"><span style="font-weight: 400">SSDP DARE</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">) committee for an open conversation about facilitating diversity and inclusion in the drug policy reform movement. </span><b><i>Please bring your own dinner.</i></b>

<b>Keynote—Almost Another Dead Black Man: My Transformation from Brutalized Student to Impassioned Advocate</b>

<i><span style="font-weight: 400">Sunday, April 17 9:45am &#8211; 10:15am </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">In 2009, Alex Landau was a 19-year-old college student with little sense of the dangers posed by the color of his skin when he was nearly killed by three Denver police officers for “driving while black.” His body was savagely beaten, as was his sense of place in the world. Alex will share how this experience catalyzed his entry into the movement for the transformation of law enforcement in the service of social and racial justice in solidarity and through a lens of passion, intersectionality, and coalition.</span>

<b>Eliminating the Need for Safe Spaces: Combating Oppression in Our Own Activist Communities</b>

<i><span style="font-weight: 400"> Sunday, April 17 10:30am &#8211; 11:45am</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400"> As activists, we tend to think of our own community as a place free of racism, sexism, queerphobia and other forms of oppression. Although we all value justice and equity, each of us has grown up in a society that normalizes oppression, which can spill over into our activist communities. In order to realize our common goal of ending the drug war, it is important that we can address oppression within our activist circles. Come hear from fellow SSDP chapter leaders on how to identify and address oppression in our chapters and on campus.</span>

<b>The Mental Illness of Drug Policy</b>

<i><span style="font-weight: 400"> Sunday, April 17 10:30am &#8211; 11:45am</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">This session will be devoted to exploring the issue of how drug policy affects the mentally ill community. We will examine rates of arrest and incarceration for drug crimes, as well as rates of recidivism among the mentally ill post-incarceration. We will take time to discuss some of the most prominent proposed solutions to this problem from a public policy standpoint.</span>

<b>The War on Drugs: Women on the Frontlines</b>

<i><span style="font-weight: 400">Sunday, April 17 4:30pm &#8211; 5:45pm</span></i>

<span style="font-weight: 400">Though men are often seen as the primary targets of the drug war, women have long been on the frontlines. Women comprise one of the fastest-growing segments of the U.S. prison population. Two-thirds of women in federal prison are there for nonviolent drug offenses. Three-quarters are mothers—many of them sole caregivers. Pregnant women and mothers are uniquely vulnerable to criminal justice involvement. Conspiracy laws coupled with mandatory minimums have sentenced women to decades—or even life—in prison simply for living with a partner in the drug trade. Meanwhile, activist groups like SSDP boast strong female leadership, and the legal cannabis industry has more female executives per capita than all U.S. businesses as a whole.The women on this panel will share powerful stories about what it means to be a woman in Drug War America.</span>
