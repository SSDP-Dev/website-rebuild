Drug policy reform is going mainstream in a significant way these days. Brad Pitt, famous actor and heartthrob, is taking on our issue. In a <a title="Brad Pitt on Sensible Drug Policy" href="http://www.politico.com/blogs/click/2012/12/brad-pitt-praises-obamas-stance-on-pot-152502.html" target="_blank">statement</a> issued yesterday, Pitt said, in response to President Obama’s recent statement about not prioritizing federal resources to target users in Colorado and Washington, “The President&#8217;s statement reflects a saner and more sensible drug policy, and a step away from the decades long failed war on drugs.”



Fighting for sensible drug policy is no longer a small behind-the-scenes effort carried on the backs of the few and far between; it’s big, it’s in plain view, and it’s now being pushed forward by the majority of Americans. We are getting closer to victory when people like Brad Pitt stand up and say, “Our jails are overburdened with nonviolent drug users in this country&#8230; This defies all common and economic sense.”



Thanks for the kind words, Brad Pitt. We support sensible drug policy too. Call us, maybe?
