Need more proof that the drug war isn&#8217;t working? Watch the above video of 20 Mexican drug cartel members dressed as police freeing 53 inmates from a Mexico jail. The cartel members arrived in 10 vehicles and a helicopter. Yes, they have fucking helicopters. <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/06/05/AR2009060503718.html">And submarines</a>. How many of the drug dealers and users that we put behind bars in the U.S. have helicopters and an underwater armada?

It&#8217;s no secret that the drug war is such a failure in the US that we aren&#8217;t even able to keep<a href="http://www.marijuanalibrary.org/junk_in_the_joint.html">drugs out of our prisons</a>, nevermind our schools. In Mexico, it seems that arresting and jailing drug cartel members does little to stop their operations; they <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/08/11/world/americas/11prisons.html?_r=2&amp;pagewanted=2&amp;th&amp;emc=th">continue their work from a jail cell</a>.
<blockquote>“When we keep a criminal in a Mexican prison, we run the risk that one way or another they are going to keep in contact with their criminal network,” Leopoldo Velarde, who heads extraditions for the federal attorney general’s office, said. “The idea is to stop criminals, not just jail them.”</blockquote>
Well, that is the idea isn&#8217;t it? I&#8217;m not old enough to remember watching the whole PabloEscobar ordeal. I&#8217;ve read extensively about the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_Bloc">Search Bloc</a> and his death. And hey, that stopped Colombian drug cartels and the flow of cocaine to the US right? Wait, it didn&#8217;t.

So we could wage an all our war with the Mexican drug cartels. We could kill all of those bastards and put our hard earned tax dollars into more military resources. We could sacrifice the lives of US soldiers and Mexican civilians can suffer 10x as much as they are now. And once we arrest, jail, or kill the cartel leaders, we can watch as new ones form and take over the violent trade as if we were never even there.

Or we could learn from history.
