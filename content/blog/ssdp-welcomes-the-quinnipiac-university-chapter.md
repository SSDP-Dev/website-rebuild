I&#8217;m thrilled to announce that SSDP has a brand new chapter at Quinnipiac University in Connecticut! Chapter leaders Anthony Arcamone and Bryan Hargrove first contacted me about starting up a chapter a few months ago, and since then have been able to secure recognition for their chapter by the school. I spoke with Anthony about his accomplishments thus far and his vision for the future:

<strong>How did you hear about SSDP?</strong><strong> </strong>

I first heard about SSDP when my roommate Bryan and I were looking up ways to change the way people thought about drugs and find a better way to educate them.

<strong>Why did you want to get involved/what made you decide to start a chapter?</strong>

I got involved because it&#8217;s a rest opportunity to educate people on both the positive and negative aspects of drugs and know there is a better way to use the money wasted on the war on drugs in this country.

<strong>What has the reception been like on campus? From students, teachers, administration, etc.</strong>

The reception of the group has been very positive from students, teachers and administration alike. All have shown interest and support in us forming the Quinnipiac chapter of SSDP.

<strong>What are some of the things you have planned or want to plan for next semester?</strong>

For our first official semester, we hope to work with other SSDP Chapters in the Connecticut and New York area, while specifically working on increasing medical marijuana education and support.

<strong>What is the most challenging part of your experience starting/running the chapter so far?</strong><strong> </strong>

So far the most challenging part of starting this chapter has been getting acclimated to running a student group, which has started to get easier as we go through the process.

<strong>What is the most rewarding part?</strong>

The most rewarding part of starting this chapter has been to see the acceptance of our ideas and knowing that there are others who agree with what we say and want to help us make positive change.

<strong>What are you most excited about for your chapter/school/state/region/<wbr />ssdp/drug policy right now?</strong>

Right now I&#8217;m most excited to push for medical marijuana so patients can have a choice of what medicine they receive and get access to something they need.

<strong>What is your vision for Quinnipiac University? Where do you see your chapter in a year? in 4 or 5 years?</strong>

I hope that this chapter continues to find strong support to carry it for years to come, so Quinnipiac can be a powerful player in drug policy reformation and education.
