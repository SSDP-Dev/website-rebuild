<p id="E49"><span id="E50" class="qowt-font2-TimesNewRoman">The United States</span><span id="E51" class="qowt-font2-TimesNewRoman"> and many other countries have focused their</span><span id="E52" class="qowt-font2-TimesNewRoman"> efforts on the criminalization of drug use.

Efforts of interdiction and law enforcement have not been met with decreases in the availability of drugs in America. Apart from being costly, drug law enforcement has been counterproductive. </span></p>
<p id="E57"><span id="E58" class="qowt-font2-TimesNewRoman">As stated by Alex Klein, in his book </span><em><span id="E59" class="qowt-font2-TimesNewRoman">Review of Nigerian Political</span><span id="E60" class="qowt-font2-TimesNewRoman"> </span><span id="E61" class="qowt-font2-TimesNewRoman">Economy:</span></em></p>
<p id="E65"><span id="E66" class="qowt-font2-TimesNewRoman">“</span><span id="E67" class="qowt-font2-TimesNewRoman">The Nigerian government has taken dramatic steps to improve the country’s reputation as an international drug trafficking centre. As most of the emphasis has fallen on law enforcement and repression there has been a sharp increase in arrest rates and the prison population. In spite of such severe measures, a correlative fall in consumption has not been registered. There is a danger that Nigeria is not only repeating the unsuccessful strategies employed by the U.S but is also failing to take account of the very different conditions in the local drug scene. It follows that the ostensible outcome of drug control &#8211; reduced consumption and trafficking &#8211; has become secondary to the manipulation of drug law enforcement for the extension of state authority and to effect societal and political control.</span><span id="E68" class="qowt-font2-TimesNewRoman">”</span><span id="E69" class="qowt-font2-TimesNewRoman"> </span></p>
<p id="E70"><span id="E71" class="qowt-font2-TimesNewRoman">In recognition of this failure, it has become expedient that a new approach to drug use and the war against it is sought. There is a need for a fundamental shift in every state&#8217;s policies against drugs. Drug policies should be formed and reformed based on health, compassion, and human rights. </span><span id="E73" class="qowt-font2-TimesNewRoman">Current drug laws </span><span id="E74" class="qowt-font2-TimesNewRoman">that criminalize drug use and addiction </span><span id="E75" class="qowt-font2-TimesNewRoman">need t</span><span id="E76" class="qowt-font2-TimesNewRoman">o be </span><span class="qowt-font2-TimesNewRoman">relaxed and nations need</span><span id="E77" class="qowt-font2-TimesNewRoman"> to shift spending from law enforcement and penalization to education, treatment, and prevention</span><span id="E78" class="qowt-font3-Arial">.</span></p>

<p id="E113"><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the conference, we wanted to educate our fellow SSDPers about the ways drug use is perceived culturally in Africa and how is differs from concerns about the effects of drug policies on drug users in general. In African culture we view drug involvement from an immoral perspective; any recreational drug use is viewed as bad. It is a child that is not properly guided and influenced by peer pressure that gets into drug use, and by extension, addiction. To our peers, questions about the ethics of drug use are never asked because in our society all drug use is unethical. This is in contrast to Western society where the level of freedom and advocacy for human rights has made the use of drugs within activist circles more normal, and there is greater tolerance to people who use drugs and more compassion towards people with addictions. We do not have the same level of cultural sensitivity associated with drug use in Africa as the western world. This does not mean that we condemn drug users as bad people, but rather explains why policies in African government’s favor a war on drugs through harmful policies towards drug users rather than policies that support drug users, and why it is so difficult to have conversations about changing those policies. The fact remains that harmful policies have never and cannot end the drug war. This is why SSDPers, irrespective of the cultural background stand together to say policies should be formed based on love, care, support, and compassion, bearing in mind that drug addiction is not a crime but a health issue.</span></p>
