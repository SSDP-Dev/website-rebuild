<h1>What Is Support. Don’t Punish?</h1>
<b>Support. Don’t Punish.</b> is a global advocacy campaign to raise awareness of the harms being caused by the war on drugs. The campaign aims to promote drug policies that respect human rights and protect public health, to change laws and policies that impede access to harm reduction interventions and other evidence-based services, and to end the criminalisation of people who use drugs. <a href="http://supportdontpunish.org/about/" target="_blank">To view the campaign’s primary messages, visit their website.</a>

<strong>Why June 26th?</strong>

June 26th is the United Nations’ International Day Against Drug Abuse and Illicit Trafficking – a day when many governments celebrate their contributions to the global ‘war on drugs’. In the past, some governments have even commemorated this day by holding public executions or beatings of drug offenders. By taking part in the Global Day of Action, you can help “reclaim” this message on this important day.

<b>#Tweet your photo to join thousands around the world! </b>

Don’t have time to go to an event or organize one yourself? No worries! One of the key components to <b>Support. Don’t Punish.</b> is the interactive photo project that you can easily contribute to. Just download the <a href="http://supportdontpunish.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/SUPPORT-DONT-PUNISH-POSTER.pdf" target="_blank">campaign poster</a>, take your photo and then send it to <a href="mailto:campaign@idpc.net" target="_blank">campaign@idpc.net</a> to be uploaded on the website, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/supportdontpunish?ref=hl" target="_blank">Facebook</a> and on <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/90322037@N05/sets/72157638043747894/" target="_blank">Flickr</a>. Send a copy to <a href="mailto:sara.velimirovic@ssdp.org" target="_blank">sara.velimirovic@ssdp.org</a> as well so we can show it off on our website too!

&nbsp;

<b>Organize an Event</b>

If you do not live near a location where a <b>Support. Don’t Punish.</b> event is already being planned, then organize one yourself! <a href="http://supportdontpunish.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/2015-Guide-for-the-Global-Day-of-Action_ENGLISH.pdf" target="_blank">Check out this Guide to the Global Day of Action to see how you can get started</a>.

The aim for the Global Day of Action is to produce high-profile and visually symbolic local actions. It is your choice to decide what these actions are. The only requirement is that these actions are connected to the global campaign by using the <a href="http://supportdontpunish.org/campaign-logos/" target="_blank">Support. Don’t Punish. logo</a>. This could be on t-shirts, banners, posters, reports or other materials. This allows us to tie together the local actions and to demonstrate that they are all part of a coordinated global effort. Also be sure to use the SSDP logo on any materials you make!

If you decide to organize an action, let us know about it by e-mailing <a href="mailto:sara.velimirovic@ssdp.org" target="_blank">sara.velimirovic@ssdp.org</a>
