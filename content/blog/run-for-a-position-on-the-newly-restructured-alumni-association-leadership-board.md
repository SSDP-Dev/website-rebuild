This month is the <a href="http://ssdp.org/alumni">Alumni Association</a>&#8216;s birthday, which means it&#8217;s time to elect our new leaders. In its first two years, the Alumni Association Leadership Board consisted of three officers per region, resulting in a board of 24 people. After careful consideration and evaluation, we have determined this is excessive to the max. We envision a day when the Alumni Association is so numerous in numbers and thriving with activity that it will warrant having 24 leaders, but today is not that day.
<div>
<div><strong>In its third year, we&#8217;re going to take the Alumni Association&#8217;s Leadership Board in a new direction.</strong> This year, we&#8217;re going to elect only three leaders, who will serve the needs of the Alumni Association as a whole, focusing on more national and international needs. These three Leadership Board members will then have the ability to appoint regional chairs to serve the Alumni Association on a regional level. This will foster accountability and better utilize our most dedicated members.</div>
<div></div>
<ul>
 	<li>If you wish to nominate yourself or someone else for the Alumni Association Leadership Board, please <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeJzDK3js8ltGCjGsOx5JRs6Ud9Tj2bwG3sw8ivaeJNmNnLng/viewform?usp=send_form" target="_blank" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?hl=en&amp;q=https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeJzDK3js8ltGCjGsOx5JRs6Ud9Tj2bwG3sw8ivaeJNmNnLng/viewform?usp%3Dsend_form&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1486751615230000&amp;usg=AFQjCNFF_S-5Fcoq01F7X2hYHX1sfwb2ng">fill out this form</a>. <b>Nominations are due <span class="aBn" data-term="goog_125422162"><span class="aQJ">Friday, Feb. 24</span></span></b>. Elections will be in March.</li>
 	<li>If you&#8217;re more interested in a regional leadership role, you can <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSf8jj-ytruOUq19-ARRM38xBj17dEDPvzmWFJAQFkAw1kdlWQ/viewform?usp=send_form" target="_blank" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?hl=en&amp;q=https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSf8jj-ytruOUq19-ARRM38xBj17dEDPvzmWFJAQFkAw1kdlWQ/viewform?usp%3Dsend_form&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1486751615230000&amp;usg=AFQjCNHxzMu1b80p4crUMGO7jAquwombeQ">fill out this form</a> to express your interest, then the Leadership Board will reach out to you after they&#8217;re elected.</li>
</ul>
<div>We&#8217;re hopeful this new structure will encourage engagement and result in a better Alumni Association for everyone. We&#8217;re dedicated to making this program work and will continue to evaluate and reexamine the status quo to ensure success for the Alumni Association and the Leadership Board.</div>
