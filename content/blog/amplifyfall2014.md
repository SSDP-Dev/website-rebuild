Festival season is winding down and tour season is gearing right back up! We’re incredibly excited to give you all an update of our work over the past few months as well as the inside scoop to all the big plans in store for the rest of the year and beyond. Well lets get to it then!

<strong><em>Summer 2014 News &amp; Updates</em></strong>

As most of you know we started the Summer by setting up at <a href="http://summercampfestival.com/" target="_blank">Summer Camp Music Festival</a> held over Labor Day weekend in Chillicothe, IL. It was a great way to start things off strong and spread our message of sensible reform to tens of thousands of live music fans.

You can read a comprehensive recap here of SCMF &#8217;14: <a href="http://ssdp.org/news/blog/summer-camp-14-gets-amplifyed/" target="_blank">http://ssdp.org/news/blog/summer-camp-14-gets-amplifyed/</a>

Following our setup at SCMF things wound down for the rest of the Summer, at least in terms of on-site setups at partnered artist shows as their tour schedules were filled with festivals stops around the country. We were however able to secure partnership with Slightly Stoopid’s “Summer Sessions” tour having volunteers in CA, MA, PA, NJ and FL alongside <a href="http://norml.org/" target="_blank">NORML</a> spreading awareness of the need for sensible cannabis reform at some of the biggest amphitheaters across the country.

<a href="http://ssdp.org/assets/Dosi-Lotus-at-RR11.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-13955 alignleft" src="http://ssdp.org/assets/Dosi-Lotus-at-RR1-300x169.jpg" alt="Dosio &amp; Lotus at RR" width="300" height="169" /></a>Our volunteer staff based in CO were lucky too as they live around one of the only guaranteed Summer stops for any touring band, the historic <a href="http://redrocksonline.com/" target="_blank">Red Rocks Park &amp; Amphitheatre</a>. Educational booths were set up on July 5th at <a href="http://umphreys.com/" target="_blank">Umphrey’s McGee</a> sold out show with over 9,500+ attendees as well as longtime supporters <a href="http://papadosio.com/" target="_blank">Papadosio</a> &amp; <a href="http://www.lotusvibes.com/" target="_blank">Lotus</a> show earlier this month on September 9th. At both we focused on spreading awareness about the comprehensive CO Good Samaritan Law and cannabis infused edibles harm reduction information to ensure those traveling from out of state stayed safe &amp; informed.

Many AMPLIFY volunteers across the country assisted in other ways by joining <a href="http://www.dancesafe.org/" target="_blank">DanceSafe</a> teams at a number of events including <a href="http://www.locknfestival.com/" target="_blank">Lockn’ Music Festival</a> in VA, <a href="http://prettylightsmusic.com/" target="_blank">Pretty Lights</a> two night run at Red Rocks, and <a href="http://www.mysteryland.us/" target="_blank">Mysteryland</a> in NY. We were incredibly happy to supplement their harm reduction efforts in so many places this year and hope the same continues for the future!

<em><b>Advocacy &amp; Educational Campaigns for Fall &amp; Winter ‘14</b></em><b>
</b>

As we move into our Fall/Winter 14’ tour season, we’re gearing up to support a number of state and national drug policy reform campaigns through on-site voter education, signature collection and targeted outreach to the live music community. In addition to supporting statewide campaigns we will also be educating attendees on already existing sensible laws in their areas. We specifically are looking for volunteers to support the following educational efforts around these specific campaigns in the coming months:
<ul>
	<li>Direct Policy Support Campaigns
<ul>
	<li><a href="http://dcmj.org/ballot-initiative/" target="_blank">DC MJ Legalization Initiative</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://voteyeson91.com/the-initiative/" target="_blank">OR MJ Legalization Initiative</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://www.unitedforcare.org/" target="_blank">FL Medical Marijuana Initiative</a></li>
	<li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/va4medicalamnesty?ref=br_tf" target="_blank">VA for Medical Amnesty Campaign
</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
	<li>Educational Awareness Campaigns
<ul>
	<li>CO Good Samaritan Law</li>
	<li>GA Good Samaritan Law</li>
	<li>IL Good Samaritan Law</li>
	<li>NY Good Samaritan Law</li>
	<li>FL Good Samaritan Law</li>
	<li>WA Good Samaritan Law</li>
	<li>CT Good Samaritan Law</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
If you, your SSDP or DanceSafe chapter are located in any of these states and are interested in promoting these campaigns please sign up below to schedule a training session and carefully review our list of partnered artist tour dates to find opportunities in your area.

<em><b>Amend the RAVE Act Campaign</b></em>

<img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-13951" src="http://ssdp.org/assets/ATRA-Logo-300x300.jpg" alt="ATRA Logo" width="300" height="300" />Moving forward we’re also going to be focussing on promoting one primary national campaign that is specific to the live music community. We’re proud to announce we are officially a part of a multi-organization coalition along with <a href="http://www.drugpolicy.org/" target="_blank">Drug Policy Alliance</a>, <a href="http://www.dancesafe.org/" target="_blank">DanceSafe</a>, <a href="http://www.maps.org/" target="_blank">Multidisciplinary Association of Psychedelic Studies (MAPS)</a>, <a href="http://ema-global.org/" target="_blank">Electronic Music Alliance</a> and <a href="http://ssdp.org/" target="_blank">Students for Sensible Drug Policy</a> supporting the <a href="https://www.amendtheraveact.org/" target="_blank">Amend the Rave Act Campaign (ATRA)</a>. Led by a Dede Goldsmith, whose daughter tragically passed away from a heatstroke after taking MDMA at an EDM event last year in DC, this campaign is designed to target the misguided policies that make event organizers and promoters fearful to embrace harm reduction at their events. You can read a detailed history of the campaign, proposed ideas for the legislation and steps moving forward in DPA’s press release <strong><a href="http://www.drugpolicy.org/news/2014/10/grieving-mother-launches-campaign-make-music-events-safer">here</a></strong>.

This past weekend, we were honored to join her on a panel at <a href="http://ssdp.org/events/2014-conference-lobby-day/" target="_blank">SSDP’s 2014 International Conference &amp; Lobby Day</a> held right outside of Washington, DC. In her first public appearance since the launch of her campaign she shared her heartbreaking story of loss and her unwavering determination to keep our children safe by working to establish safer settings at these events through sensible policy change.

You can view the entire panel on our Youtube page here: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/AMPLIFYProject/videos" target="_blank">http://www.youtube.com/user/AMPLIFYProject/videos</a>
