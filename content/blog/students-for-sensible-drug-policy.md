So we stumbled across this <a href="http://www.examiner.com/x-11932-Portland-Drug-Policy-Examiner~y2009m8d24-Drug-offenders-to-get-student-loans--again#comments">opinion piece</a> on proposed <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2009/08/07/drug-offenders-federal-student-aid-new/">reform of the HEA</a> that would restore financial aid to students with drug possession convictions. The author is in favor of barring aid students with drug convictions.

Here&#8217;s a breakdown and commentary of my favorite parts of this brilliant piece:
<blockquote>Remember the gigantic bust of students selling drugs this last spring? 75 students were busted selling marijuana, cocaine, and heroin out of several dorms and 5 Frat houses at <a href="http://ssdp.org/sdsu/">San Diego State University</a>.</blockquote>
I remember. That was the big drug bust that finally won the drug war wasn&#8217;t it? Go on, go on&#8230;
<blockquote>How many former users, are now to be allowed student loans again, (eligible again because of the progressive Democrat majority)? How many will begin to use drugs while in college? How many convicted users will “relapse” due to the stress of college and grades? Are drug users stable and reliable in the first place? Is it right to make loans to former users going to school when they didn’t care about the importance of keeping a good record in the first place?</blockquote>
Those damn progressives! How dare those &#8220;convicted users&#8221; get a second chance? Are drug users stable enough to go to school? I can&#8217;t believe this guy is serious. If I have a few beers with my dinner, am I not &#8220;stable&#8221; enough to go to work the next day? As you&#8217;ll see in the new book, <a href="http://www.saferchoice.org/content/view/910/9/">Marijuana is SAFER</a>, alcohol causes many more problems to society and to a persons health than marijuana. So you should also support removing aid from those that drink alcohol. And if you can find me one person that isn&#8217;t technically a drug user, we&#8217;ll end this whole thing right now&#8230; Ok then, I&#8217;ll keep going.
<blockquote>We have Democrat California Congressman George Miller, and 45 different cosponsors to thank for H.R. 3221; it overturns / reverses sections of the bill passed back in 1998 those sections were intended to keep drug use and drug dealers out of colleges. One has to wonder how the parents will feel about their children sharing a dorm room with a user or dealer.</blockquote>
Here&#8217;s a newsflash: the bill didn&#8217;t work! The HEA Aid Elimination Penalty did not work to keep drug dealers out of colleges, drugs off our streets or out of children&#8217;s hands. If it did, students wouldn&#8217;t be buying drugs or using them at the rate that you quoted: &#8220;Of 18 – 22 year old college students illicit drug use was at 37.5% &#8211; while non-student use for the same age group was 38.4%&#8221; And really, if this prohibition thing works so well, and we&#8217;ve been doing it for decades, why are drug use rates so high? Oh that&#8217;s right&#8230; blame the progressives!
<blockquote>Kris Krane, (executive director) of <a href="http://www.schoolsnotprisons.com/">Students for “Sensible” Drug Policy</a>, (a pro-drug group) called the old law requiring the student to qualify by keeping clean, ”unfair because of double jeopardy” – and that it impacted students of color and low income more than others.

Other than users and legalizers, Adam Wolf, staff attorney for the ACLU and parents whose children began using drugs and lost their student loans over the last decade, would probably support reform.</blockquote>
So now SSDP is a &#8220;pro-drug group&#8221; and the Sensible in SSDP is in quotations. Gimme a break. I doubt he even read our <a href="http://www.ssdp.org/about">mission statement</a>. He couldn&#8217;t have read it before calling us pro-drug. Calling us pro drug is about as ignorant as calling someone that is against the war in Iraq a terrorist.

This guy didn&#8217;t do ANY research before writing this! Its really kind of funny! I mean, a simple google search of Aid Elimination Penalty bring ups CHEAR &#8211; <a href="http://www.raiseyourvoice.com/">The Coalition for Higher Education Act Reform</a> which, aside from &#8220;users and legalizers&#8221; includes some of these organizations:

American Bar Association
American Council on Education
United States Student Association
National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers
United Church of Christ
Building Better Lives for Our Communities and Kids (Building BLOCK)
Center for Juvenile and Criminal Justice
Center for Women Policy Studies
Center on Juvenile and Criminal Justice

Oh and about <a href="http://www.raiseyourvoice.com/supporters.shtml">390 other organizations</a> and <a href="http://www.raiseyourvoice.com/studentendorse.html">115 student governments</a> including:

Yale University (also has a scholarship program for students that have lost aid)
Brown University (also has a scholarship program for students that have lost aid)
Franklin Pierce University
Columbia University
Dartmouth College
George Washington University

He ends it all with a fine piece of advice for learning about drug policy:
<blockquote>If you’re interested, there’s numbers of others … just go to the DEA website and search university students and drugs …</blockquote>
Brilliant! Why didn&#8217;t I think of that?

That&#8217;s all I&#8217;ve got for now.
