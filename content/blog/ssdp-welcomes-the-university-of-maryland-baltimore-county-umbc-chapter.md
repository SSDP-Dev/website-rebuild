I am excited to announce the formation of our newest official chapter, <a title="UMBC SSDP" href="http://ssdp.org/chapters/mid-atlantic/maryland/university-of-maryland-baltimore-county-umbc/" target="_blank">University of Maryland Baltimore County (UMBC)</a>! With <a title="Maryland marijuana bills" href="http://ssdp.org/action/take-action-tell-your-representative-to-support-maryland-marijuana-bills/" target="_blank">multiple medical marijuana and decriminalization bills</a>, and one <a title="Maryland marijuana legalization bill" href="http://ssdp.org/action/hb-1453-legalize-marijuana-in-maryland/" target="_blank">legalization bill</a> in the Legislature, <a title="SSDP chapters in Maryland" href="http://ssdp.org/chapters/mid-atlantic/maryland/" target="_blank">Maryland</a> is a hotbed for drug policy reform this year, and it&#8217;s fantastic that we have the UMBC chapter up and ready to help out with the fight!

I spoke with chapter founder and leader Nitin Sampathi about his experience so far and his hopes and vision for his chapter moving forward:

&nbsp;

<b>How did you hear about SSDP? </b>

<b></b>I knew I wanted to start a club concerning drug policy but didn&#8217;t know where to start. I spoke to my friend at <a title="UMD College Park SSDP" href="http://ssdp.org/chapters/mid-atlantic/maryland/university-of-maryland-umd/" target="_blank">UMD College Park</a>, Tyler Kutner, and he informed me about an SSDP chapter.

&nbsp;

<b>Why did you want to get involved/what made you decide to start a chapter?</b>

<b></b>I&#8217;ve always been interested into drug policy but ever since I felt the effect of the drug laws first hand, I knew this was something that I needed to do so others wouldn&#8217;t have to go through this.

&nbsp;

<b>What has the reception been like on campus? From students, teachers, administration, etc.</b>

<b></b>Most of our campus has yet to hear about us but I am sure the reception will be positive. There are many open-minded clubs that I am sure share the same ideology as us, yet don&#8217;t focus on drug policy.

&nbsp;

<b>What are some of the things you have planned or want to plan for next semester?</b>

<b></b>SSDP t-shirts, <a title="Drug war documentaries" href="http://ssdp.org/resources/movies-and-documentaries/" target="_blank">documentary</a> screenings and a bake sale!

&nbsp;

<b>What is the most challenging part of your experience starting/running the chapter so far? </b>

<b></b>We haven&#8217;t come along any real problems yet but I would imagine getting the word out of our cause to give us some difficulties, but it&#8217;s nothing that we can&#8217;t overcome!

&nbsp;

<b>What is the most rewarding part?</b>

<b></b>Educating and informing people. Especially with drug policy and drugs in general, there is A LOT of misinformation and basically just lies. I am excited to open and challenge people&#8217;s minds, to hear other viewpoints and hopefully teach someone, and learn, something new.

&nbsp;

<b>What are you most excited about for your chapter, school, or state right now?</b>

<b></b>I feel like Maryland is approaching a realization of the failed drug policies and is a lot further than other states. Campus-wise, this club is like no other and expands the range of clubs we have here. I am excited to start tabling, to speak to others, and to start making change!

&nbsp;

<b>What is your vision for SSDP? Where do you see your chapter in a year? in 4 or 5 years?</b>

<b></b>I see SSDP becoming a very big club on campus and our presence will be felt and seen. In the next year I hope we can work together with other clubs and other nearby chapters. In the next 4 or 5 years? oh gosh, hopefully by then we have made some real big change but regardless our motivation and determination will still be far from gone.
