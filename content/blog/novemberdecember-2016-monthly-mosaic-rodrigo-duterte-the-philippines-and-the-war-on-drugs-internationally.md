<span style="font-weight: 400;">— </span><a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-37172002"><span style="font-weight: 400;">President Rodrigo Duterte’s warning  to drug dealers</span></a>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">While still on the campaign trail, Duterte famously </span><a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-37172002"><span style="font-weight: 400;">promised to kill 100,000 criminals in his first six months in office</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Since he took office on June 30th, at least </span><a href="http://www.npr.org/sections/parallels/2016/11/28/503579840/in-philippines-drug-war-death-toll-rises-and-so-do-concerns-about-tactics"><span style="font-weight: 400;">5,000 people have been killed</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in the War on Drugs — </span><a href="http://www.npr.org/sections/parallels/2016/11/28/503579840/in-philippines-drug-war-death-toll-rises-and-so-do-concerns-about-tactics"><span style="font-weight: 400;">2,000</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by the Philippines National Police, and </span><a href="http://www.npr.org/sections/parallels/2016/11/28/503579840/in-philippines-drug-war-death-toll-rises-and-so-do-concerns-about-tactics"><span style="font-weight: 400;">3,000</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in extrajudicial or vigilante-style killings (killings by government officials or citizens with no legal basis). In July alone, </span><a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3691692/Drug-addicts-Philippines-surrender-authorities-president-Rodrigo-Duterte-urges-citizens-ahead-kill-drug-users-dealers.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">over 60,000 individuals addicted to drugs voluntarily turned themselves into authorities</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, motivated by a legitimate fear for their lives. </span>

<h2><b>PUTTING THE PHILIPPINES’ WAR ON DRUGS IN AN INTERNATIONAL CONTEXT</b></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The United Nations (UN) has condemned the extrajudicial killings encouraged by Duterte as “</span><a href="http://www.unodc.org/unodc/en/press/releases/2016/August/statement-by-the-unodc-executive-director-on-the-situation-in-the-philippines.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">illegal and a breach of fundamental rights and freedoms</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">,” and his administration&#8217;s actions have, in fact, violated both individual UN agreements and the Philippines’ human rights obligations as a </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Member_states_of_the_United_Nations"><span style="font-weight: 400;">member state</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.  </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Following the UN’s </span><a href="http://www.unodc.org/ungass2016/en/about.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Special Session on the World Drug Problem meeting in April 2016 (UNGASS)</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the UN released an </span><a href="https://documents-dds-ny.un.org/doc/UNDOC/LTD/V16/017/77/PDF/V1601777.pdf?OpenElement"><span style="font-weight: 400;">outcome document </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that called for </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Member_states_of_the_United_Nations"><span style="font-weight: 400;">UN member states</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, such as the Philippines, to “prevent any possible acts of cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, in accordance with domestic legislation and applicable international law.” </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The extrajudicial killings also potentially violate  the ongoing </span><a href="http://www.un.org/en/preventgenocide/adviser/responsibility.shtml"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Responsibility to Protect </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">commitment  to protect populations from “genocide, war crimes, crimes against humanity and ethnic cleansing, and their incitement” made by United Nations member states.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">In most cases, the next logical step for diplomatic strategy would be a call to action from the</span><a href="http://asean.org/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Association of Southeast Asian Nations</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (ASEAN) to place political pressure on Duterte to end the extrajudicial killings and disregard of habeas corpus. However, Duterte has </span><a href="http://www.gmanetwork.com/news/story/580679/news/nation/duterte-accepts-chairmanship-of-asean-2017"><span style="font-weight: 400;">accepted chairmanship</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for the ASEAN 2017 summit, making it unlikely that the region will unite to put an end to the internal violence against suspected</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">drug users and dealers.  </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, Duterte has publicly mulled over withdrawing from the International Criminal Court (ICC), deeming it “</span><a href="http://thewire.in/81031/philippines-may-follow-russias-withdrawal-icc/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">useless</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.” This move would not be unprecedented: </span><a href="http://www.nation.co.ke/news/world/Russia-withdraws-from-ICC/1068-3455602-13ddj16/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Russia recently  withdrew as a signatory</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> following allegations of war crimes towards civilians in Syria, and </span><a href="http://www.newsweek.com/icc-international-criminal-court-africa-gambia-south-africa-burundi-515870"><span style="font-weight: 400;">several African nations have announced their intended withdrawal</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> as well. However, Filipino withdrawal from the ICC would seriously hamper the United Nations from pursuing tribunals for wrongful deaths under Duterte.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">U.S. diplomacy could play a crucial role in ending the killings and incarceration of thousands of Filipinos. Unfortunately, relations have been strained, at best. Although the Philippines, a former U.S. colony, has long boasted the </span><a href="http://www.pewglobal.org/database/indicator/1/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">strongest support for the U.S. of any country on Earth</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (In 2015, </span><a href="http://www.pewglobal.org/database/indicator/1/country/173/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> 92%</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of Filipinos had a favorable view compared to </span><a href="http://www.pewglobal.org/database/indicator/1/country/233/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">83%</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of Americans), diplomatic relations began to sour after Duterte took office. Soon after Duterte was announced the presumptive president, U.S. President Barack Obama made a </span><a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2016/05/17/readout-presidents-call-president-elect-rodrigo-duterte-philippines"><span style="font-weight: 400;">diplomatic phone call</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to the new world leader, commending the Philippines for its &#8220;vibrant democracy,&#8221; while also highlighting &#8220;enduring values&#8221; that underpinned their &#8220;longstanding ties,&#8221; including &#8220;shared commitments to democracy, human rights and rule of law.&#8221; Duterte responded to what he saw as criticism of his victory and impending War on Crime by publicly </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/06/son-of-a-whore-was-not-meant-to-be-personal-duterte-tells-obama"><span style="font-weight: 400;">calling US President Barack Obama a “son of a whore,”</span></a> <span style="font-weight: 400;">resulting in a</span> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/06/son-of-a-whore-was-not-meant-to-be-personal-duterte-tells-obama"><span style="font-weight: 400;">canceled meeting</span></a> <span style="font-weight: 400;">between the two leaders during the 2016 ASEAN summit.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Even within that context, there is still hope in Southeast Asia for drug policy reform to model pragmatic alternatives to Duterte’s drug war. Myanmar, a </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Triangle_(Southeast_Asia)"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Golden Triangle</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (one of Asia’s two top opium-producing areas) country, is currently </span><a href="http://www.talkingdrugs.org/united-nations-supporting-myanmar-burma-drug-reform"><span style="font-weight: 400;">receiving United Nations support</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to reform policies. The </span><a href="https://www.unodc.org/southeastasiaandpacific/en/myanmar/2015/03/drug-law/story.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">joint recommendations supported by the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime and the Chief of the Myanmar Police Force</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> include: 1) the removal of compulsory registration for people who use drugs; 2) a recommendation to transfer programs for people who use drugs from prison to drug treatment centers; 3) a reduction of penalties for small offenders; and 4) the inclusion of a harm reduction approach in programming. This beacon of hope in the region will do little to immediately end the violent drug war in the Philippines, but it could create momentum for reform in other Southeast Asian countries. </span>

<h2><b>HEGEMONY IN THE PHILIPPINES: NATIONAL POPULARITY, INTERNATIONAL SCORN</b></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Though many in the international community have been horrified by Duterte’s methods, he boasts a </span><a href="http://www.philstar.com/headlines/2016/11/17/1644692/filipinos-rate-duterte-admin-very-good-drug-war-excellent"><span style="font-weight: 400;">high approval rating</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> among his own people (though </span><a href="http://thediplomat.com/2016/10/the-truth-about-dutertes-popularity-in-the-philippines/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">some argue</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that, within a historical context, his approval rating is not particularly notable).  A </span><a href="http://www.philstar.com/headlines/2016/11/17/1644692/filipinos-rate-duterte-admin-very-good-drug-war-excellent"><span style="font-weight: 400;">September Social Weather Stations (SWS) survey</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of 1,200 respondents found a </span><a href="http://www.philstar.com/headlines/2016/11/17/1644692/filipinos-rate-duterte-admin-very-good-drug-war-excellent"><span style="font-weight: 400;">75% satisfaction rating overall</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, with </span><a href="http://www.philstar.com/headlines/2016/11/17/1644692/filipinos-rate-duterte-admin-very-good-drug-war-excellent"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Duterte’s drug policies in particular receiving an &#8220;excellent&#8221; rating</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and a high +78 net score. The Duterte administration also scored well on “</span><a href="http://www.philstar.com/headlines/2016/11/17/1644692/filipinos-rate-duterte-admin-very-good-drug-war-excellent"><span style="font-weight: 400;">promoting human rights</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">” and “</span><a href="http://www.philstar.com/headlines/2016/11/17/1644692/filipinos-rate-duterte-admin-very-good-drug-war-excellent"><span style="font-weight: 400;">helping the poor,</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">” both with a net score of +63.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Duterte’s supporters </span><a href="http://www.npr.org/sections/parallels/2016/09/23/495012102/criticized-abroad-philippines-leader-remains-hugely-popular-in-home-city"><span style="font-weight: 400;">argue</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that you “cannot guarantee development if your peace and order, security and safety, is not guaranteed for all citizens,” though they twist this statement to justify the</span><a href="http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/794598/kill-list-drugs-duterte"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> growing list of people killed in Duterte’s efforts to crack down on crime</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Many Filipinos believe that </span><a href="http://www.manilatimes.net/did-aquino-coddle-and-protect-drug-lords/270562/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">years of corruption and incompetence under former President Aquino</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> cultivated a widespread illicit drug market that Duterte must now rein in. In that context, Duterte’s </span><a href="http://www.cnn.com/2016/08/07/asia/duterte-war-on-drugs-officials-named/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">continually updated public lists</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of “</span><a href="http://cnnphilippines.com/news/2016/08/19/President-Duterte-list-of-drug-personalities-politicians.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">drug personalities</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">” and “</span><a href="http://cnnphilippines.com/news/2016/08/19/President-Duterte-list-of-drug-personalities-politicians.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">narco-politicians</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">,” which implicate a range of politicians — from low-level street cops to high ranking congress members — have been </span><a href="http://www.npr.org/sections/parallels/2016/09/23/495012102/criticized-abroad-philippines-leader-remains-hugely-popular-in-home-city"><span style="font-weight: 400;">lauded</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> as  a never-before-seen move to hold government accountable for its role in corruption.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">This mass support for the new president has created a nationalistic fervor in which Filipino politics, news, and </span><a href="http://cnnphilippines.com/life/culture/politics/2016/05/09/social-media-elections.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">social media</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> target those who are critical of Duterte’s tactics. </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leila_de_Lima"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Senator Leila De Lima</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, one of the most vocal figures in Filipino government to speak out against Duterte’s drug war, has been the </span><a href="http://news.abs-cbn.com/focus/11/25/16/slut-shaming-de-lima-congressmens-questions-about-a-scandal"><span style="font-weight: 400;">target</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of cyber-bullying, slander and defamation, as well as allegations of corruption and involvement in the drug trade herself. Investigative journalists, </span><a href="http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/848933/duterte-threatens-to-kill-human-rights-activists-if-drug-problem-worsens"><span style="font-weight: 400;">human rights activists</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and even UN delegates have been </span><a href="http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/848933/duterte-threatens-to-kill-human-rights-activists-if-drug-problem-worsens"><span style="font-weight: 400;">shamed, threatened, and cursed</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by Duterte for questioning the validity of his methods. Duterte has even </span><a href="http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/848933/duterte-threatens-to-kill-human-rights-activists-if-drug-problem-worsens"><span style="font-weight: 400;">threatened to add protesters to his kill lists</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on grounds of worsening the Philippines’ problems with drugs. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Of course, not all Filipinos are in support of Duterte’s methods, chief among them the families of the dead, many of  whom may never know the true stories of how their loved ones died. </span>
