I don&#8217;t care who you vote for. I really don&#8217;t. Obama, McCain, Nader, Moore, whatever. Still holding out hope for Ron Paul? Fine, just vote.

Please make sure your voices are heard on this day. It will be exciting to watch the results come in, but it will be even more exciting to watch the drug policy reform movement, as a whole, gear up and make plans for 2009 and beyond.

VOTE. VOTE. VOTE.
