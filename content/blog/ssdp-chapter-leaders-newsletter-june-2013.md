Hi again SSDP rockstars!



We hope you are all enjoying your summer! Here is another installment of our monthly chapter leaders newsletter to keep you in the loop about what&#8217;s new and on the horizon for Students for Sensible Drug Policy.



2013 Federal Marijuana Lobby Day



This past June, SSDP students from across the country came to Washington, D.C. to lobby legislators for federal marijuana reform. With over 50 students present, SSDP was able to make our voice heard in the halls of Congress. After lobbying, we held a reception on Capitol Hill with special guests Rep. Jared Polis (D-CO), and conservative stalwart, Grover Norquist.
