<span style="font-weight: 400;">on Narcotic Drugs. These intersessional meetings are an opportunity for members of the Commission to discuss progress made on the resolutions &amp; discussions that took place during the annual CND meeting in March. This intersessional meeting saw a lively discussion emerge regarding Canada’s legalization of adult-use cannabis. A number of member states, most vocally Russia, expressed opposition to the policy and called Canada’s policy a fundamental breach of the international drug control framework. Only one member state, New Zealand, expressed direct support for Canada, though a handful of other delegations (USA, Netherlands, France, and Germany) emphasized that the CND is not a place to single out the policies of one member state. Other topics discussed at the intersessional included a progress update on revisions to the Annual Report Questionnaire, a data collection survey filled out by member states each year, and updates regarding preparations for the 2019 High-Level Ministerial Segment. </span><a href="https://ssdp.org/blog/takeaways-from-the-second-intersessional-meeting-of-the-61st-commission-on-narcotic-drugs/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Check out the full takeaways of the SSDP delegation here. </span></a></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">SSDP members in the United States attended the New York launch of the World Drug Report at the UN headquarters. This annual publication by the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) contains research and data on drug use from all over the world. Yuri Fedotov, the Executive Director of the UNODC, made some introductory remarks where he called for member states to expand the availability of evidence-based treatment programs. Angela Me, the UNODC’s Director of Research, then presented some of the major findings of this year’s World Drug Report. One of the more notable findings was that reports of seizures related to cannabis use are dropping around the globe, indicating that the global attitude towards cannabis is shifting. In response to these findings, representatives from member states gave short talks to demonstrate their own local situations as well as their own goals in moving toward a safer world. Notably, Jamaica’s representative pushed for making information accessible and understandable to everyone rather than just those that are more educated than the majority of the global population. </span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the World Health Organization, an expert committee on drug dependence met in Geneva for a critical review of CBD, the first time such a meeting has focused on just one substance. Over 12 people gave video or in-person presentations, and 15 member states sent observers. The final outcome for CBD will come at the end of the summer along with a preliminary outcome for cannabis that could lead to a similar critical review.</span></li>
