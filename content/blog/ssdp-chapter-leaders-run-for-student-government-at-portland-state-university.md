Two of our very own SSDP rockstars are running for student government!

Portland State University is currently holding elections for its student government body and the chapter leaders of <a title="Portland State SSDP" href="http://ssdp.org/chapters/west-coast/oregon/portland-state-university/" target="_blank">Portland State SSDP</a>, Greta Gibbens and Romain Bonilla, have volunteered as tribute to represent their fellow students and promote sensible drug policies on their campus.

For close to a year, Greta and Romain have been leading a grassroots campaign to enact comprehensive <a title="Good Samaritan Policies" href="http://ssdp.org/campaigns/call-911-good-samaritan-policies/" target="_blank">911 Good Samaritan Policies</a> at their school. According to Greta: “Good Samaritan Policies not only save lives by encouraging to call for help during a drug overdose, but also protect those wishing to report sexual assault on-campus.”Earlier this year, Portland State SSDP formed a Good Samaritan Coalition to team up with other student organizations in promoting these efforts.

&#8220;I’m excited to see how we can promote these policies through student government,” says Greta, “I don’t know if I would have tried running for office before getting involved with SSDP.”

Greta and Romain are running on a candidate slate called <a href="https://www.facebook.com/sfabtt" target="_blank">Students for a Better Tomorrow Today</a>, which is <a href="http://studentsforabettertomorrowtoday.org/issues-2/" target="_blank">championing</a> the issue of Good Samaritan Policies. The slate includes over 20 students, all united in their dedication to sensible policies on their campus, and SSDP is proud to endorse these promising candidates in their campaign for Portland State’s student government.

Best of luck to Greta and Romain in the ongoing election!
