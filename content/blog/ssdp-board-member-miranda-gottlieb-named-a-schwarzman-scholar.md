Miranda Gottlieb, a former chapter leader at the University of Tennessee, Knoxville, and current SSDP Board Member has been named to the second class of Schwarzman Scholars, a program designed to give exceptional students the chance to develop leadership skills and professional networks through a master&#8217;s degree program in China.

Gottlieb, who is from New Mexico, earned her bachelor&#8217;s degree in honors political science and Hispanic studies in May 2016. She was a Baker Scholar in the Howard H. Baker Jr. Center for Public Policy where she studied Native American cannabis reform. She was president of Students for Sensible Drug Policy while a student and was elected to the SSDP Board of Directors in April of 2016. She completed internships at the New Mexico Department of Health and the Drug Policy Alliance, studied abroad in Costa Rica and Argentina, and was a speaker at TEDxUTK 2016.

Over the summer, Gottlieb interned with U.S. Rep. Steve Cohen in Washington, D.C. Until her departure to China, she will work on overdose prevention for the State of Florida. In the future her goal is to work for the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime to promote harm reduction strategies in new international policy directives.

“Being named a Schwarzman Scholar to support my development as an academic and leader in the field of drug policy reaffirms to me that there is no substitute for passion when pursuing your goals. I am so thankful for SSDP in helping and supporting me to achieve this invaluable opportunity,” Gottlieb said.

At SSDP 2016, she presented alongside other panelists in a session titled &#8220;Funding Your Dreams” where strategies and opportunities were presented for academic scholarships and navigating fundraising. Gottlieb also received the award of “Outstanding Student Organizer of the Year” at this past years’ conference.

The application process was facilitated by the University of Tennessee’s Office of National Scholarships and Fellowships (ONSF). Gottlieb, who was also named a finalist for the British Marshall scholarship has worked on applications for competitive national and international scholarships for four years.

“Although relatively new, Schwarzman Scholars already is one of the most selective scholarship programs in the world,&#8221; said Andrew Seidler, ONSF director.
The Schwarzman Scholars program was created last year to respond to the geopolitical landscape of the 21st century. It was founded by Stephen A. Schwarzman, chairman, CEO and co-founder of Blackstone, a global asset management firm. Schwarzman donated $100 million launch the Schwarzman Scholars program and is leading a campaign to raise $300 million more to fully endow the program, which is the single largest charitable effort in China&#8217;s history coming from largely international donors.

The second cohort of scholars will study for a year at Beijing’s Tsinghua University for a master of global affairs degree in one of three disciplines: public policy, economics and business, or international studies. They will also study Mandarin. The students will have the opportunity to pursue internships at organizations in China, work closely with a senior Chinese mentor, and travel throughout China.
