This past weekend, a bill to legalize marijuana as a palliative for the chronically ill was passed by the Connecticut State Senate. This now makes 17 states and the District of Columbia that have passed legislation in support of medical marijuana. The bill passed the Senate 21-13, passed the house 96-51, and is currently on its way to Governor Malloy’s desk, where he is expected to sign the bill into law.



Connecticut SSDP students have been working tirelessly this past semester to help gain support for this legislation. Our students worked to host rallies, coordinated student lobbying efforts, testified in front of lawmakers, and personally called members of the House and Senate to express their support for the bill. This win could not have happened without their diligent efforts throughout this entire legislative session. Congratulations to our <a href="http://ssdp.org/chapters/northeast/connecticut" target="_blank">Connecticut SSDPers</a> for being an integral part of this policy changing process.
