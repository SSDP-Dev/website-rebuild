We&#8217;re so excited to announce the date and location of our 2012 Students for Sensible Drug Policy National Conference:



<strong>March 24-25, 2012</strong>



<strong>Hyatt Regency Denver Tech Center

7800 East Tufts Avenue

Denver, Colorado, USA 80237  </strong>



More information is coming soon, so please <a href="http://ssdp.org/events/2012-national-ssdp-conference">RSVP here</a> if you&#8217;d like to be kept in the loop about early bird registration and other important conference details.



Earlier this year, over 400 students gathered in Washington DC for our training conference and lobby day, and we hope to make next year&#8217;s conference even bigger and better.



Hope to see you there!
