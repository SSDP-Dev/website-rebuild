<h2><b>Resolutions We’re Making (And You Should Too!)</b></h2>
<ol>
<ol>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400"><b>Diversify the topics of discussion. </b><span style="font-weight: 400">The drug war is a many-headed beast. A high-quality chapter should have conversations on different aspects of the drug war and the many different areas and ways  in which to make positive change. The </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">Monthly Mosaic </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">is one good resource for identifying issue areas and techniques. You can also check out </span><a href="http://ssdp.org/diversity"><span style="font-weight: 400">ssdp.org/diversity</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> for a list of identifiers to get your chapter thinking about how the War on Drugs is impacting different communities. </span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400"><b>Utilize different teaching methods</b><span style="font-weight: 400">. Everyone learns, grows, and processes information in different ways. Read more about different learning styles </span><a href="http://www.educatorstechnology.com/2013/03/6-learning-methods-every-21st-century.html"><span style="font-weight: 400">here</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> to understand how you can get your point across to different audiences.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400"><b>Allow everyone to have a voice in your chapter. </b><span style="font-weight: 400"> As well intentioned as the drug policy movement is, we can make the mistake of ignoring or speaking over the voices of the most marginalized. Be mindful of others with different experiences and privileges than your own. Check out this </span><a href="http://blog.conventionbusinesstravel.com/5-ways-to-make-sure-that-everyone-in-the-meeting-gets-heard/"><span style="font-weight: 400">blog post</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> on how you can make sure everyone is heard during a meeting.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400"><b><b>Build alliances. </b><span style="font-weight: 400">Network with other student activists on campus by organizing a social and inviting other groups,  or attending another student organization’s event as a chapter. Look up your school’s list of student organizations and pick one or two to get involved with.</span></b></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400"><b>Self-care. </b><span style="font-weight: 400">Many activists put others’ needs before their own, and can burn themselves out.  It is important for us to know our own limits and to make sure our needs are being met.</span> <span style="font-weight: 400">Check out tips on self-care </span><a href="http://nonprofitwithballs.com/2013/08/7-tips-for-self-care-for-nonprofit-staff/"><span style="font-weight: 400">here</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">.</span></li>
