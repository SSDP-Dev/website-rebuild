<b>“</b><b>In the public mind, the ‘war on drugs’ probably conjures up a male image. </b><b>In most countries, official statistics would show that men, indeed, are the majority of people who use drugs recreationally, who have problematic use, and who sell drugs. But </b><b>punitive drug laws and policies pose a heavy burden on women</b><b> and, in turn, on the children for whom women are often the principal caregivers.”</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400">Thanks to the drug war, </span><a href="http://www.drugpolicy.org/sites/default/files/DPA_Fact%20Sheet_Women%20Prison%20and%20Drug%20War%20%28Feb.%202016%29.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400">women are one of the fastest-growing segments of the U.S. prison population</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">, with the number of women in state and federal prisons growing by </span><a href="http://www.drugpolicy.org/sites/default/files/DPA_Fact%20Sheet_Women%20Prison%20and%20Drug%20War%20%28Feb.%202016%29.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400">nearly 800%</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> between 1978 and 2014. </span><a href="http://www.drugpolicy.org/sites/default/files/DPA_Fact%20Sheet_Women%20Prison%20and%20Drug%20War%20%28Feb.%202016%29.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400">The U.S. houses almost 30% of the world’s incarcerated women despite being home to only 5% of the world’s female population</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">. </span><a href="http://www.drugpolicy.org/sites/default/files/DPA_Fact%20Sheet_Women%20Prison%20and%20Drug%20War%20%28Feb.%202016%29.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400">The 25 jurisdictions that have the highest global rates of female incarceration are all U.S. states</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">.

</span><span style="font-weight: 400">Not all these women are even guilty of what most people would consider an actual crime. Conspiracy offenses—sometimes referred to as wife and girlfriend laws—are perhaps one of the most egregious examples of the drug war’s inequitable treatment of women.</span>

&nbsp;

<b>“Although conspiracy laws were designed to target members of illicit drug organizations, </b><b>they have swept up many women for being guilty of nothing more than living with a husband or boyfriend</b><b> involved in some level of drug sales. </b><b>Harsh mandatory minimum sentencing may keep them behind bars for 20 years, 30 years, or even life.</b><b>”</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400">Motherhood also puts women—particularly women of color—at increased risk of drug war prosecution. </span><a href="http://www.drugpolicy.org/sites/default/files/DPA_Fact%20Sheet_Women%20Prison%20and%20Drug%20War%20%28Feb.%202016%29.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400">Even though black women are no more likely than white women to use illicit drugs during pregnancy, they are ten times as likely to be reported to child welfare services for drug use.</span> </a>

<b>“Pregnant women who are incarcerated for drug law violations often do not receive prenatal care. </b><b>Children are routinely separated from their imprisoned mothers</b><b>, causing irreparable damage to the child. </b><b>Prisons and jails commonly use restraints (handcuffs and shackles) on women in labor and during delivery</b><b>, regardless of their histories.”</b>

&nbsp;

<b>“The same failed tactics used to fight drugs continue to be used to retain control over women’s reproduction. </b><b>Drug laws are increasingly being implemented on the state level as a roundabout method to limit women’s bodily autonomy</b><b> and carry out anti-choice agendas.”</b>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400">Organizations like the </span><a href="http://www.flcalliance.org"><span style="font-weight: 400">Family Law and Cannabis Alliance</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> and the </span><a href="http://www.advocatesforpregnantwomen.org"><span style="font-weight: 400">National Advocates for Pregnant Women</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> are working  to support women combating these punitive policies, but the news is not all sunny.
</span>In 2014,  <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/tennessee-criminalize-pregnant-women-drug-use_us_56dee8f9e4b0000de405c7f3">Tennessee became the first state in the country to pass a law specifically making it a crime to use drugs while pregnant.</a> Tennessee’s “fetal assault law,” which made the use of  illicit drugs while pregnant a crime punishable by up to 15 years in prison, could possibly expire in July, but the fight is far from over. <a href="http://www.heraldbulletin.com/news/drug-tests-for-pregnant-women-approved/article_1aec3860-e1d3-11e5-ad99-4300edef471c.html"> In Indiana, for example, doctors are currently calling for all pregnant women to be drug tested</a>.
<span style="font-weight: 400">However, while the drug war is responsible for innumerable collateral consequences, many of which disproportionately impact the lives of women, women’s role in both the licit and illicit drug world is not entirely one of powerlessness. </span>

&nbsp;

<b>“</b><b>Women are not only powerful actors in the drug world, but their work is central to the drug economy.</b><b> Women routinely perform four core activities (e.g. providing housing and sustenance needs, purchasing drugs, subsidizing male dependency, and participating in drug sales) that are both fundamental to drug world organization and earn them important forms of capital that may facilitate future, conventional pursuits.”</b>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400">Perhaps because of the huge impact the drug war has played in female lives, women have become some of the most powerful advocates of reforming harmful drug policies, with a growing network of organizations—such as the </span><a href="http://normlwomensalliance.org/"><span style="font-weight: 400">NORML Women’s Alliance</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">, </span><a href="http://www.mamas.org/"><span style="font-weight: 400">Mothers Against Misuse and Abuse</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">, </span><a href="http://www.momsformarijuana.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400">Moms for Marijuana</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">, </span><a href="http://womengrow.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400">Women Grow</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">, and more—tapping into this incredible energy to create change.</span>

&nbsp;

<b>“Legalization advocates have found that </b><b>female support tends to be a leading indicator for marijuana measures</b><b>. In the case of both California&#8217;s 2010 and Colorado&#8217;s 2006 votes, sagging support among women preceded a collapse in men&#8217;s support too. In California, for instance, support from women saw a 14-point swing against legalization over the final six weeks, dragging support from men under 50 percent.”</b>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400">Women aren’t just voting for change though; they’re actively putting their money behind their beliefs, with the burgeoning legal cannabis industry increasingly attracting female entrepreneurs. </span>

&nbsp;

<b>“</b><b>The cannabis industry hasn’t been very welcoming to women in the past, which is perhaps one reason for the historical dearth of females working at marijuana companies. But that appears to be changing quickly&#8230;</b><b>Women now make up a sizable—and growing—portion of the executive ranks in the marijuana industry</b><b>, including 63% of high-level positions at testing labs and nearly 50% of such roles at infused products and processing companies.”</b>
