SSDP is now a group on MTV think. Create a profile and join the group right <a href="http://think.mtv.com/Groups/SSDP/">here</a>.

I know what your thinking. MTV? Involved with something that isn&#8217;t lowering the quality of popular music and convincing the average 16 year old that they are entitled to a Mercedes Benz and a birthday party that is incomplete without flame throwing trapeze artists and Siberian Tigers? Yes actually.

MTV think is super cool and promotes that young people should organize, speak out, vote, and have a say in policies that affect them. By <a href="http://think.mtv.com/Groups/SSDP/">joining</a> the SSDP group you can promote discussions, upload videos and audio, complete goals and earn badges/prizes, and network with plenty of other organizations and young people from around the world. Groups are broken up into issues such as substance abuse, poverty, health, education, human rights and environment (unfortunately each group is only allowed to pick 2 issues and SSDP is related to just about all of them). One important part of <a href="http://think.mtv.com/">think</a> is that it allows us to bring the reform message to young people that are concerned about substance abuse but haven&#8217;t heard our side of the story yet. Check out this<a href="http://think.mtv.com/044FDFFFF0002D79CFFFF00000069/Forum/IssueForum.aspx">forum</a>.

Please create a profile and join the group (we only have one member right now and its me!)
