Here at SSDP, we hope you and your families had a wonderful holiday and we look forward to the new year to bring about more sensibility to policies surrounding drugs.

If you have a little extra Christmas cheer you&#8217;d like to spread, <a href="http://daregeneration.blogspot.com/www.ssdp.org/conference/donate">please donate</a> to the Missouri Southern State University (MSSU) SSDP chapter and help them come out to San Francisco on March 12, 2010 for <a href="http://daregeneration.blogspot.com/www.ssdp.org/conference">This is Your Brain on Drug Policy</a>: SSDP&#8217;s International Drug Policy Reform Conference.

The chapter at MSSU has been one of SSDP&#8217;s most active and talented chapters to date. Just check out all the cool stuff that comes up after a <a href="http://www.google.com/search?client=safari&amp;rls=en&amp;q=mssu+ssdp&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8">google search of MSSU SSDP</a>. You&#8217;ll be impressed.

MSSU also submitted this downright hilarious yet <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Drpo9Ca8cf0&amp;feature=player_embedded">heartwarming video</a> of chapter members hoping that <a href="http://daregeneration.blogspot.com/www.ssdp.org/conference/donate">Santa Claus will bring them</a> what they truly want for Christmas.
