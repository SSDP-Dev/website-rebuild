<p dir="ltr"><a href="http://www.drugpolicy.org/resource/one-million-police-hours">A new report</a> released yesterday shows us that during the last ten years, the NYPD has spent approximately <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/gabriel-sayegh/new-york-marijuana-arrests_b_2910102.html">1,000,000 police hours arresting people for marijuana possession</a>. In that time, they have managed to arrest over 440,000 people for minor marijuana charges, costing taxpayers over 75 million dollars last year alone. These are hours that police officers might have otherwise have spent investigating and solving serious crimes like rape, murder, and robbery, but instead has been spent on failed drug war tactics. We cannot arrest our way out of this problem. Marijuana arrests have only increased over the last 20 years. Most of these arrests are the outcome of <a href="http://www.npr.org/2013/03/18/174415367/lawsuit-over-nypd-s-stop-and-frisk-program-heads-to-court">controversial and unlawful NYPD practices like stop-and-frisk and arrest quotas.</a> Yet, marijuana still remains on the streets, and communities of color and young people are carrying arrest records on their backs. More than 84 percent of those arrested last year were people of color – even though young whites use marijuana at higher rates.</p>

<p dir="ltr">This report comes to us at a time when legislators in Albany <a href="http://www.theatlanticwire.com/national/2013/03/new-york-decriminalizing-pot-bloomberg-charts/63302/">are actually considering a law that would decriminalize marijuana in the state of New York. </a>This is good news for drug policy reformers. There has never been a better time for reform. With the governor and legislators in Albany determining if they’re going to enact new laws, it gives us a unique opportunity to take action and encourage lawmakers to make the right choice.</p>
