Drug cartel members burst into a Juarez drug rehabilation clinic yesterday, <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/nm/20090903/wl_nm/us_mexico_drugs">lining up patients and executing 17</a> of them. On the same day, newly appointed ( 2 weeks ago ) deputy police chief Jose Manuel Revueltas, was killed in President Calderon&#8217;s home state of Michoacan in western Mexico by heavily armed men in two vehicles just a few blocks from police headquarters.

How many <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_Valentine%27s_Day_massacre">Saint Valentine&#8217;s Day Massacres</a> do we need to witness before we end drug prohibition? I&#8217;m not feeling like ranting so here are some current <a href="http://stopthedrugwar.org/">highlights from the drug war</a>:
<ul>
	<li>13,000 people have been killed since late 2006</li>
	<li>Obama plans to give <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/latestCrisis/idUSN01511085">$1.4 billion</a> to aid fighting drug cartels (aka, wasting tax dollars and increasing violence)</li>
	<li>Ciudad Juarez has become the <a href="http://blogs.reuters.com/global/2009/08/28/violent-ciudad-juarez/">most violent city on earth</a>.</li>
	<li>In 2009 there have been 4,736 murders in Mexico</li>
	<li>There have been 24,000 arrests in 2009 and the violence still continues</li>
</ul>
