Google has <a href="http://fdlaction.firedoglake.com/2010/08/25/google-to-run-just-say-now-ads-censored-by-facebook/">accepted our Just Say Now marijuana legalization ads</a>.

&nbsp;

Just this week, the ads were removed by Facebook, which claimed that the image of a marijuana leaf was in violation of its policy – despite the fact that the ad had at least 38 million impressions on Facebook earlier this month. The ads will begin running on Google’s advertising network immediately.

&nbsp;

Clearly, Google is more mature than Facebook when it comes to political speech.

&nbsp;

Bruce Fein, former Associate Attorney General for President Ronald Reagan and Just Say Now advisory board member, had this to say:

&nbsp;
<blockquote>“Facebook’s concocted prissiness over political advocacy is more to be disparaged than imitated. Freedom of expression is made of sterner stuff.  Google deserves applause for exposing Facebook to shame.”</blockquote>
