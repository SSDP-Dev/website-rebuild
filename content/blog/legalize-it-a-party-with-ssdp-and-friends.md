<div><strong>Washington, DC</strong> – Students for Sensible Drug Policy (SSDP) and actor Tray Cheney (&#8220;Poot&#8221;) of The Wire, will honor Niambe Tosh, daughter of legendary singer and activist Peter Tosh and U.S. Rep. Jared Polis (D-CO) for their extraordinary efforts in the fight to legalize marijuana.SSDP’s honorees have been committed advocates to the cause. Peter Tosh called on the world to &#8216;Legalize It&#8217; six years after President Richard Nixon officially declared the ‘War on Drugs,’ and as a mother, teacher and a key member of her father&#8217;s Estate, his daughter Niambe carries on that fight today. Congressman Polis stood out as the first member of Congress to specifically call for marijuana legalization from the floor of the U.S. House of Representatives in December 2010.  He also introduced medical marijuana legislation and was an original cosponsor of the first-ever marijuana legalization bill in Congress, introduced in June 2011.

We’re educating students, parents, and teachers around the country that, in reality, the War on Drugs is a war on all of us.”



Congressman Jared Polis, a leader in Congress on marijuana legalization, said, &#8220;America’s 40 year drug war has indisputably failed. SSDP is a leader in educating and mobilizing young people on this issue.
