Believe it or not, two weeks ago marked the first time in history that a member of Congress specifically called for taxing and regulating marijuana like alcohol — from the floor of the House of Representatives!

During debate over a <a href="http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/z?c111:H.RES.1540:">terrible pro-drug war resolution</a> that was cynically fast-tracked through the House by Speaker Nancy Pelosi, the lone member to rise in opposition was <a href="http://polis.house.gov/">Congressman Jared Polis</a> from Colorado. During his speech, he said &#8220;by eliminating the failed policy of prohibition with regard to marijuana and replacing it with regulation, we can cut the money to the criminal gangs by half.&#8221;

Of course, Congressman Ron Paul (R-TX) has consistently supported ending drug prohibition over the years, but my searches failed to turn up a specific call for regulating marijuana from the well of the House. Rep. Paul was one of the handful of members who voted against the resolution that Polis opposed. (I welcome any corrections from nerds who are good at searching the <em>Congressional Record</em> if I am wrong about Dr. Paul previously making a similar speech from the House floor.)
