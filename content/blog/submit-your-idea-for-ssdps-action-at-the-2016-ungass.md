<span style="font-weight: 400">On Monday April 18th, SSDP students and allies will board busses from our annual conference in Washington, DC to New York City to join allies in public demonstrations drawing attention to the 2016 UNGASS. This is an opportunity to bring youth voices together in one large action that will send a clear message to UN member states on the eve of the UNGASS. Corresponding to the global reform movement, our action should convey a message that falls in line with the issues outlined by the </span><a href="https://stoptheharm.org"><span style="font-weight: 400">Stop the Harm</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> campaign. More information about the global campaign and the core messages can be found at </span><a href="https://stoptheharm.org/issues"><span style="font-weight: 400">https://stoptheharm.org/issues.</span></a>

<span style="font-weight: 400"><strong>SSDP students and alumni, along with global youth allies fighting for sensible drug policies, are invited to submit proposals to determine what kind of action we will be holding on April 18th.</strong> Your submission should include a framework for a scalable action, the resources and budget you expect the action to require, a description of why you believe the action will best represent 1-3 core messages of the global campaign and particularly youth-related issues.</span>

<b>How to participate:</b>
<span style="font-weight: 400">You can submit your idea through </span><a href="https://docs.google.com/a/ssdp.org/forms/d/14sq4hhFoq5tZ2Og-HIELgGBsW304a30qJSJgI200dRo/viewform"><b>this Google Form</b></a><span style="font-weight: 400">. The competition is open to students and alumni from SSDP, CSSDP, and SSDP UK as well as global youth allies. The winning action will be announced on November 21st at the Reform Conference during the conclusion of SSDPÂ´s Model UNGASS. The individual or team who submitted the winning action will be invited to join the SSDP planning committee for the event and, if the winner is a member of SSDP, a scholarship will be awarded to SSDP2016 and to New York for the UNGASS events. If you have any questions, feel free to contact Jake Agliata at </span><a href="mailto:jake@ssdp.org"><span style="font-weight: 400">jake@ssdp.org</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">.
