With regard to the incident at Wesleyan University, Students for Sensible Drug Policy declines to comment on the ongoing criminal investigation. The Wesleyan chapter of SSDP was re-established in 2013 by Andrew Olson, who is its current co-president along with two other members.

<strong>Statement from Betty Aldworth, Executive Director of Students for Sensible Drug Policy:</strong>
Students for Sensible Drug Policy neither condones nor condemns drug use; we acknowledge that people use drugs regardless of prohibition and that drugs are best managed through public health measures and regulatory frameworks, not the criminal justice system.

SSDP was founded in part to help protect people, especially young people, minimize the harm from drugs. We are saddened every time someone is injured in their use of drugs. We express to the injured students our best wishes for a speedy and complete recovery, and a resumption of their studies and their privacy.

The fact is that prohibition of drugs, and laws against health-based approaches that could make drug use less dangerous, has created a situation where a black market is responsible for producing drugs of unknown composition, purity, and potency. Rather than demonize otherwise successful young people for engaging in activities that happen on campuses across the world every weekend, we should all be appalled that young people&#8217;s lives have once again been endangered by failed laws that inevitably lead to overdose and that other young people&#8217;s lives will be disrupted as they get dragged into the criminal justice system. At Wesleyan, one in 13 students was disciplined for a drug violation in 2013, proving that this scenario will play out again and again until we end drug prohibition and replace it with laws based on justice, compassion, evidence, and common sense.
