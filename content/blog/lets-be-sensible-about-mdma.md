Will it be a sober night, or will they choose to consume alcohol or another drug of unknown origin, potency, or composition regardless of rules or prohibitions against doing so? Based on government data about drug use, we can conservatively estimate that in the last month 12 million students chose to consume alcohol, 4 million marijuana, and another 4 million another drug. Thousands of students were likely involved in distributing illicit drugs and alcohol, usually through sharing with friends. A few of them will be evicted from campus housing, ineligible to receive grants, expelled from school, or thrown into the criminal justice system where their futures will be wasted as surely as the tax dollars used to house them are.

There was only one different thing about last Saturday: of the thousands of students who consumed something they thought was MDMA, some students at Wesleyan University instead (or additionally) had something far more dangerous. It could have happened anywhere, and to any of those students. Thankfully, the one student still hospitalized as of this writing is expected to recover. In the resulting investigation, a member of Students for Sensible Drug Policy was arrested along with three others, all of whom have been suspended and are facing serious charges.
