<strong>Six National Drug Policy Organizations Call on President Obama to End Unnecessary Assault on Medical Marijuana Providers</strong>



<strong>Coalition to President Obama: “It is time for a new approach on marijuana policy.”</strong>



<strong>Contact: </strong>Aaron Houston, (202) 455-5869



WASHINGTON, D.C. &#8212; In the wake of recent attacks on medical marijuana providers and patients by multiple branches of the federal government, including Monday&#8217;s raids on Oaksterdam University in Oakland, CA, a coalition of six national drug policy reform organizations is appealing to President Obama and his administration to follow its own previously stated policies respecting state medical marijuana laws. In the letter, posted in full below, the organizations call on the Obama administration to bring an end to the federal government’s ongoing campaign to undermine state efforts to regulate safe and legal access to medical marijuana for those patients who rely on it.



The Obama Administration’s National Drug Control Strategy Report 2012, reportedly being released in the coming days, is expected to cling to failed and outdated marijuana policies which further cement the control of the marijuana trade in the hands of drug cartels and illegal operators, endangering both patients in medical marijuana states and citizens everywhere. The members of this coalition stand together with <a href="http://www.globalcommissionondrugs.org/bios/">members of the Global Commission on Drug Policy</a>, current and former Latin American leaders whose countries are being ravaged by drug cartels, <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/04/02/lawmakers-in-5-states-tell-feds-medical-marijuana_n_1397811.html?ref=politics">state officials from five medical marijuana states</a>, and tens of millions of Americans in their call for a more rational approach to marijuana policy.

THE LETTER TO PRESIDENT OBAMA:



&nbsp;



April 4, 2012



&nbsp;



President Barack Obama



The White House



Washington D.C. 20500



Via Fax: 2024562461



&nbsp;



Dear Mr. President:



Our coalition represents the views of tens of millions of Americans who believe the war on medical marijuana patients and providers you are fighting is misguided and counterproductive. As your administration prepares to release its annual National Drug Control Strategy, we want to speak with one voice and convey our deep sense of anger and disappointment in your lack of leadership on this issue.



Voters and elected officials in sixteen states and the District of Columbia have determined that the medical use of marijuana should be legal. In many of these states, the laws also include means for providing medical marijuana patients safe access to this medicine. These laws allowing for the cultivation and distribution of medical marijuana actually shift control of marijuana sales from the criminal underground to state-licensed, taxed, and regulated producers and distributors.



Instead of celebrating – or even tolerating – this state experimentation, which has benefited patients and taken profits away from drug cartels, you have turned your back as career law enforcement officials have run roughshod over some of the most professional and well-regulated medical marijuana providers. We simply cannot understand why you have reneged on your administration’s earlier policy of respecting state medical marijuana laws.



Our frustration and confusion over your administration’s uncalled-for attacks on state-authorized medical marijuana providers was best summed up by John McCowen, the chair of the Mendocino County (CA) board of supervisors, who said, “It&#8217;s almost as if there was a conscious effort to drive [medical marijuana cultivation and distribution] back underground. My opinion is that&#8217;s going to further endanger public safety and the environment – the federal government doesn&#8217;t seem to care about that.”



The National Drug Control Strategy you are about to release will no doubt call for a continuation of policies that have as a primary goal the ongoing and permanent control of the marijuana trade by drug cartels and organized crime. We cannot and do not endorse the continued embrace of this utterly failed policy. We stand instead with Latin American leaders, members of the Global Commission on Drug Policy, and the vast majority of people who voted you into office in recognizing that it is time for a new approach on marijuana policy.



With approximately 50,000 people dead in Mexico over the past five years as the result of drug war-related violence, we hope that you will immediately reconsider your drug control strategy and will work with, not against, states and organizations that are attempting to shift control of marijuana cultivation and sales, at least as it applies to medical marijuana, to a controlled and regulated market.



Sincerely,



Students for Sensible Drug Policy (SSDP)
