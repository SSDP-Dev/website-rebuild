Meet Cody Prouty, the chapter leader of <a href="http://ssdp.org/chapters/pacific/oregon/portland-state-university/" target="_blank">Students for Sensible Drug Policy at Portland State University</a>. He is currently a 3rd year studying biochemistry and psychology.

Cody has always been interested in pharmacology, drug policy, and how stigma and misconceptions around drugs and drug users arise. This summer, he watched a lecture given by David Nutt and Amanda Fielding from the Beckley Foundation, when a spark was lit, and he became obsessed with the field of drug policy education and reform.

To him, drug policy is deeply personal. When he was younger, one of his close family members was addicted to multiple narcotics, which spiraled into homelessness for about a month. His doorway into drug policy reform was spurred out of his experience with homelessness.

With SSDP, his main goal is to spread awareness about the negative impact of the War on Drugs. He hopes to remove the stigma surrounding drug use and drug users, specifically through research into psychedelics and chemistry.

This year, the Portland State University Chapter has already held two fundraising bake sales, and is planning to host a MAPS Global Psychedelic Dinner by the end of the year.
