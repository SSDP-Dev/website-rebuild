This afternoon, I and our lovely intern Alica attended a panel and discussion at the Brookings Institute on the federal government&#8217;s response to Colorado and Washington legalizing marijuana.



One of the people leading the panel was Troy Eid, former US Attorney for Colorado. I asked him about his ideal solution for how the federal government should respond to states legalizing marijuana, and his answer showed remarkable pragmatism and sensibility;



He agreed with us that a sensible approach would be for the federal government to defer to the states on this issue, just like the way alcohol is treated now.
