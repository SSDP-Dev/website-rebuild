Meet Sam Krause, the leader of the first <a href="http://ssdp.org/chapters/pacific/oregon/mount-hood-community-college/" target="_blank">SSDP chapter at Mount Hood Community College</a> in Gresham, Oregon. Sam decided to start a chapter of Students for Sensible Drug Policy in Spring of 2015 in order to educate people about Measure 91, a medical cannabis legalization initiative in Oregon. Last year, he organized a panel featuring lawyers, journalists and medical cannabis educators to educate the campus about the policy.

Since starting SSDP, he’s recruited many followers to the cause, many of whom are interested in learning and educating others about the effects and policies surrounding psychedelic substances. Outside of SSDP, Samuel writes for The Advocate, a campus paper, and works at a nonprofit called The Troublesome Movement with at-risk youth. After cannabis prohibition, Samuel is interested in working on expungements from people’s records for non-violent drug offenses and bringing rehabilitative programs to those who are currently incarcerated.
