<strong>Organizing tip of the Week: Collecting Feedback</strong>



One of the best ways to determine if you are doing a good job as a student organizer is to ask for feedback from your peers. Obtaining constructive feedback from your chapter members, alumni, or supporters is extremely useful and overall will help you improve your skills as an organizer. You should always encourage open discourse regarding feedback through conversation, officer meetings, Facebook, or online forums, but sometimes chapter members may not be as comfortable talking about the subject. This is where anonymous feedback can be a great tool.



There are varying viewpoints on the effectiveness of anonymous feedback, but in my personal experience as an SSDP chapter leader I have found it overwhelmingly helpful. Getting honest opinions on your work is hard to do, and few are willing to say things in public. By allowing your members to remain anonymous, you can get a more realistic perception of how your work is being viewed and how effective you are at achieving the goals you set forth for your SSDP chapter.



<strong> There are endless methods for collecting feedback, but here are a few methods I have found to be particularly helpful: </strong>

<ul>

	<li>Handwritten feedback at the end of events or meetings allows immediate results while ideas are still fresh on the mind. (Simply provide paper and pens)</li>

	<li>Creating a <a href="http://support.google.com/docs/bin/answer.py?hl=en&amp;answer=87809">Google form</a> allows for convenient and organized feedback anytime of day and you can share it with your chapter officers once its collected with the click of a button.</li>

	<li>Creating an anonymous survey using <a href="http://www.surveymonkey.com/">Survey Monkey</a>. Survey Monkey is a great tool, and allows for easy data collection and analysis.</li>

</ul>

<strong>Goals of Collecting Feedback: </strong>

<ul>

	<li>Help students understand the distinction between criticism and feedback. Feedback describes what took place and what did not take place in terms of goals.</li>

	<li>Allow students opportunities for providing anonymous feedback.</li>

	<li>Focus the questions and encourage the students to focus their responses on behaviors and processes, not your personality.</li>

</ul>

<strong> Follow-up with the feedback results: </strong>

<ul>

	<li>Focus on using the data for improvement.</li>

	<li>Respond to students’ feedback with proposed changes</li>

	<li>Reinforce mutual feedback by thanking students for their input.</li>

	<li>Reassure students that their feedback will not impact their relationship with the chapter or compromise an officer position.</li>

</ul>

Now you know the importance of Feedback, and different methods of collection! So, go ahead and give it a try today!
