<p>Each year, the Students for Sensible Drug Policy board, staff, and select students and alumni come together for an in-person “Strategy Summit.” Earlier this summer, we gathered in Denver, CO to discuss the activities and direction of the organization and came to conclusions on our plan for the upcoming year. This plan is finalized as our <a href="https://ssdp.org/strategy/">2018-2019 SSDP Organizational Objectives</a>, which guide our work throughout the year and hold the staff and board accountable to SSDP’s 4,000+ student members. We’re proud to share this year’s objectives with you.</p>

<h1 style="color: #136F8D;" id="movementbuilding">Movement Building</h1>

<h2 style="color: #636467;" id="strengtheningthenetwork">STRENGTHENING THE NETWORK</h2>

<p>We will support 4,500 students for sensible drug policy in 50 US states and 32 countries.</p>

<p>We will continue to develop and grow the SSDP <a href="http://ssdp.org/alumni">Alumni Association</a> program, more strongly connecting students to Alumni members through the mentorship program, keeping Alumni engaged as advocates, and developing Alumni as philanthropists. Membership will grow to more than 260 members.</p>

<p>We will provide meaningful, region-specific resources and support to our international chapter network and seek out opportunities to empower international SSDP chapters within the SSDP network.</p>

<p>We will pilot a program to recruit and train four <a href="https://ssdp.org/blog/introducing-our-global-fellows/">Global Fellows</a> in global regions with high levels of SSDP activity that will enhance the capacity of our chapters to engage in meaningful policy change and coalition building.</p>

<p>We — staff and members — will collaborate with allies from across the political spectrum and non-drug policy reform groups to spread our message of reform.</p>

<p>We will actively engage our stakeholders through regular, meaningful, and carefully curated contact.</p>

<p>We will seize compelling opportunities to address external audiences concerning drug policy reform and to engage in public dialogues.</p>

<h2 style="color: #636467;" id="bringingpeopletogether">BRINGING PEOPLE TOGETHER</h2>

<p>Our staff will utilize professional best practices in event planning, execution, and evaluation.  </p>

<p>We will work with local chapters and Alumni Association members to host state and regional training, advocacy, or educational events, attended by an average of 50 participants, in 8 locations.</p>

<p>We will successfully execute the <a href="https://conference.ssdp.org/">SSDP2019 Conference</a> in Spring 2019 with at least 350 attendees.</p>

<p>We will connect donors, alumni, and student members by hosting networking receptions in major cities and supporting members in hosting networking and fundraising events.</p>

<h2 style="color: #636467;" id="creatingsafespacesandfosteringdiversity">CREATING SAFE SPACES AND FOSTERING DIVERSITY</h2>

<p>We will provide a welcoming, open, and safe space for all stakeholders, but especially our members, including those who stand in conflict on other issues, and work to ensure that a wide range of perspectives are represented.</p>

<p>We will actively seek out opportunities for collaboration with other organizations, including non-drug policy reform groups and those beyond our traditional allies.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://ssdp.org/dare/">Diversity, Awareness, Reflection, and Education Committee</a> will create and/or compile resources to assist chapters navigating diversity issues on their campuses, which staff will make accessible to chapters. DARE will assist staff in navigating diversity issues at the organizational level.</p>

<p>We will make every attempt to ensure that SSDP events, including conferences, provide a welcoming environment for current and potential members. We will strive to provide recognition of their lived experiences, i.e. first-hand accounts and impressions of life as a member of a marginalized group.</p>

<p>The Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCU) Working Group will receive resources and support to expand SSDP’s engagement with historically Black colleges and universities and support more African American students in the SSDP network.</p>

<p>The International Organizing Committee (IOC) will work with staff to ensure our existing chapter materials are globally applicable and curate new, region-specific advocacy materials for our international chapters, including translation of resources into Spanish and other languages.</p>

<p>We will facilitate active youth participation at drug policy conferences and events and SSDP participation in related conferences and events which are not specific to drug policy.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://ssdp.org/justsayknow/">Just Say Know peer education program</a> will promote open and honest dialogue around drug use, drug policy, and drug culture.</p>

<p>We will improve our strong, unified, and professional brand and all team members will endeavor to adhere to brand principles and encourage chapters to do the same by equipping them with the SSDP style guide.
