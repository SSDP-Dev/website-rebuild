<a href="http://www.orlandosentinel.com/opinion/os-ed-millennial-opposes-medical-marijuana-new-voices-102716-20161027-story.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">When reading the Orlando Sentinel the other day,</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> I was enraged to discover that there are people my age who oppose  medical marijuana in Florida, and worse still, who believe there is no “conclusive evidence marijuana is an effective treatment for anything.” </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Andrew Sutton, fellow 24-year-old and political director for the No On 2 campaign, is outrageously misinformed on the subject of medical marijuana and the reasons why the overwhelming majority of Floridians support it. He says that, “As far as I can tell, people support Amendment 2 for three reasons: They believe it will help the sick, they believe even if it doesn&#8217;t help, it couldn&#8217;t hurt, [and] they believe marijuana should be legalized&#8230;”</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Sutton may be correct in that some people support the amendment for those reasons, but fails to understand that there are many more. </span><a href="http://unitedforcare.org/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">United for Care</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> recently came out with </span><a href="https://scontent-mia1-2.xx.fbcdn.net/t31.0-8/s960x960/14681048_10154475191605767_3633821162879048408_o.jpg" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">10 reasons to vote yes Amendment 2</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which include the facts that states allowing medical marijuana have shown a 25% decrease in opiate overdose deaths, have fewer suicides by veterans with PTSD, and have shown no change in illicit teen use of the substance (and have even shown decreased use in some age demographics).</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">In Sutton’s editorial statement, he writes that there is “no conclusive evidence marijuana is an effective treatment for anything” and cited this claim with a small list of 4 medical associations that oppose Amendment 2. Countering this erroneous claim is United for Care’s </span><a href="http://www.unitedforcare.org/medical_professionals_support_medical_marijuana" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">list of 102 medical professionals in Florida who support the amendment</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, as well as the </span><a href="http://www.care2.com/causes/21-influential-medical-organizations-that-support-marijuana-reform.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">many other medical organizations</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that support medical marijuana. Sutton states that the American Medical Association opposes medical marijuana because “the evidence simply isn’t there,” a lie debunked by </span><a href="http://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/article-abstract/2338266" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">a study done by the organization’s own peer-reviewed journal.</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> In addition to this, I will include </span><a href="http://norml.org/component/zoo/category/recent-research-on-medical-marijuana" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">a link to a trove of excellent research compiled by the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that strongly suggest medical marijuana can treat over 20 serious medical conditions.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">While Sutton’s claim that Amendment 2 hasn’t received any money from “Big Pharma” is correct, the main donor of the No On 2 campaign is a </span><a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/06/13/sheldon-adelson-medical-marijuana_n_5492894.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">casino tycoon from Las Vegas who paradoxically funded medical marijuana research in Israel that found huge potential in its ability to treat multiple sclerosis.</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> The founder of the No On 2 campaign, Mel Sembler, </span><a href="https://www.thenation.com/article/gop-mogul-behind-drug-rehab-torture-centers-bankrolling-opposition-pot-legalization-colo/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">had to shut down his adolescent rehabilitation clinics after multiple lawsuits and documented cases of child abuse</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Depressingly, another large donor to the No On 2 campaign is Carol Jenkins Barnett, heiress to Publix supermarkets and sufferer of Alzheimer’s, who unfortunately isn’t aware that </span><a href="https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2016/06/160629095609.htm" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">marijuana has been shown to be effective in removing Alzheimer’s-causing plaque from the brain.</span></a>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Sutton complains that supporters of Amendment 2 are “anti-intellectual[s]” making claims without any evidence, while he himself makes the same type of claims, like “the jury&#8217;s still out on whether marijuana is linked to schizophrenia, or a hefty drop in IQ.” Although a </span><a href="http://psychcentral.com/news/2013/12/10/harvard-marijuana-doesnt-cause-schizophrenia/63148.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Harvard University study</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> shows that cannabis use does not </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">cause</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> schizophrenia, but may trigger the disorder in those already at risk, </span><a href="https://www.endoca.com/blog/news/cbd-oil-schizophrenia-new-study/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">another study</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> shows that CBD, a non-psychoactive cannabinoid (chemical in the plant), may even be able to </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">treat </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">schizophrenia. Sutton’s bogus claim that marijuana may lower IQ has also been </span><a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2016/01/twins-study-finds-no-evidence-marijuana-lowers-iq-teens" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">thoroughly debunked.</span></a>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Sutton’s lies are an insult to the struggles of the hundreds of patients I’ve met working for this campaign over the last three years that so obviously benefit from this plant. His words are a disgrace to intellectuals, fellow millennials, and </span><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2014/10/01/92-of-patients-say-medical-marijuana-works/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">the 92% of medical marijuana patients nationwide who say it helps</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> alleviate the symptoms of their serious medical conditions. To keep throwing these patients in jail just because the </span><a href="http://miamiherald.typepad.com/nakedpolitics/2015/04/meidcal-marijuana-campaign-relaunches-after-florida-house-ends-lawmaking-session.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Florida legislature has failed to pass laws that will help them</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is a crime against humanity that must be remedied with the passing of Amendment 2 on Tuesday. </span>
