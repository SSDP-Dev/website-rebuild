I&#8217;m thrilled to introduce Matthew Company, the chapter leader of SSDP at California State Polytechnic University Pomona. Read on to learn more about why he and his leadership team got involved with SSDP!

<strong>Why did you want to get involved in SSDP?</strong>

Many substances should be decriminalized and studied so that we can reduce drug-related crimes and promote further study of these substances. The War on Drugs has increased violent drug-related crimes, and decriminalization will lead to a more civil humanity.

<strong>What does a sensible drug policy mean to you?</strong>

Currently, a drug-related offense is often subject to the same level of prosecution as a more dangerous offense. A sensible drug policy would acknowledge that drugs have benefits as well as harms, and would inform people of all their possible options when it comes to drug use. It would also include options for war veterans suffering from PTSD to receive proper treatment.

<strong>What do you hope to accomplish this year?</strong>

We hope to assist with making political change, raising awareness, and doing community service in Pomona.

<strong>What challenges have you faced and how do you plan to overcome then?</strong>

It has been difficult to generate student interest on a commuter campus. However, we plan to host large-scale seminars and events to raise awareness and garner a name for ourselves on the topic of harm reduction.

<strong>What advice would you give to people looking to get involved in SSDP?</strong>

Be open minded, don’t lose drive when progress seems slow.

<strong>A fun fact?</strong>

With such a prevalent drug problem in Pomona, we would like to get involved to halt the problem facing the community and its citizens.
