I am proud to welcome the <a title="UGA SSDP" href="http://ssdp.org/chapters/mid-atlantic/georgia/university-of-georgia-uga/">University of Georgia chapter</a> to the SSDP network! I spoke with chapter founder and current leader Benjamin Consuegra about his experience so far and his vision for the chapter moving forward;



&nbsp;



<strong>How did you hear about SSDP?</strong>

I heard about SSDP while doing research for a speech on the drug conviction question on the FAFSA.

<div><strong>Why did you want to get involved/what made you decide to start a chapter?</strong></div>

<div>I wanted to get involved in order to stop just being one of those people that talks about our insane drug policy. I wanted to actually try and help in some way. I started the chapter at UGA because I saw that Georgia State and Kennesaw State had chapters and thought it was ridiculous that UGA wasn&#8217;t represented.</div>

<div><strong>What has the reception been like on campus? From students, teachers, administration?</strong></div>

<div>So far the reception has been positive. I was interviewed on 1340AM WGAU in Athens, a Cox Radio station, and the responses from those who heard me were in agreement, albeit confused on what &#8220;sensible&#8221; means.</div>

&nbsp;

<div></div>

<div></div>

<div><strong>What are some of the things you have planned or want to plan for the Fall 2012 and Spring 2013 semesters?</strong></div>

<div>I would like to plan a few &#8220;Get the Word Out&#8221; events. Essentially, I would like to set-up at a few shows at various venues in Athens, GA and hand out literature and talk with people about what we believe. I would also like to show a documentary or two about the drug war. Lastly, I would love to plan a lecture/debate type of a situation with someone from the legalization/reform side vs. the prohibition side, sort of a &#8220;heads vs. feds&#8221; type of thing. I would also like to be able to point students in the direction of treatment facilities or lawyers should they need that type of help.</div>

&nbsp;

<div></div>

<div></div>

<div><strong>What is the most challenging part of your experience starting/running the chapter so far?</strong></div>

<div>Figuring out how to balance schoolwork, a social life, and the work required for this group.</div>

&nbsp;

<div></div>

<div></div>

<div><strong>What is the most rewarding part?</strong></div>

<div>Changing a person&#8217;s mind about the direction our country is going regarding drug policy.</div>

<div></div>

&nbsp;

<div></div>

<div><strong>What are you most excited about for your chapter/school/state/region/ssdp/drug policy right now?</strong></div>

<div>The possible legalization of marijuana in Colorado is a huge step-forward for everyone in this movement. Once people see that the citizens of that state don&#8217;t get lost in a haze of pot smoke and Dorito dust, we can begin to talk seriously about what legalized marijuana would look like.</div>

<div></div>

&nbsp;

<div></div>

<div><strong>What is your vision for UGA SSDP? Where do you see your chapter in a year? in 4 or 5 years?</strong></div>

I would just like to see UGA SSDP continuously growing and adding new members, handing out literature, and forcing a discussion every year about drug policy on campus, in Georgia, and the U.S. as a whole. In 4 or 5 years, I would like to see this organization having an annual event like the debates that I mentioned before. I want every student on campus to know that we exist.
