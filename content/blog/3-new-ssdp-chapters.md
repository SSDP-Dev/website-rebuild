We&#8217;re proud to welcome new officially established SSDP chapters at <a href="http://ssdp.org/chapters/southern/louisiana/lsus">Louisiana State University &#8211; Shreveport,</a> <a href="http://ssdp.org/chapters/southern/texas/uhcl">University of Houston &#8211; Clear Lake</a>, and <a href="http://ssdp.org/chapters/northeast/pennsylvania/upitt">University of Pittsburgh</a> this week!

<strong></strong>The LSUS Student News covered the newly created chapter, watch an excerpt of the video report here.
Rachal Cox learned about SSDP from friends who are involved in one of our strongest chapters at the <a href="http://ssdp.org/chapters/southern/arkansas/university-of-arkansas">University of Arkansas &#8211; Fayetteville</a>. Currently, LSUS is our only active chapter in Louisiana, and they&#8217;ve quickly gotten things up and running in just a few short weeks.

Klaire Moss found SSDP online last summer and was interested in developing her skills as an activist. Using the<a href="http://ssdp.org/resources">resources we have available</a>, she gathered other interested students and went through the school&#8217;s process for creating a new student organization. This new chapter makes 2 in the city of Houston, TX, joining the <a href="http://ssdp.org/chapters/southern/texas/university-of-houston">University of Houston</a> as strong voices for reform in the south.

<strong><a href="http://ssdp.org/chapters/northeast/pennsylvania/upitt">University of Pittsburgh
</a></strong><strong><em>Pittsburgh, PA &#8211; <a href="http://ssdp.org/chapters/northeast">Northeast Region</a></em></strong>

Julia Johnson and the other students at UPitt have been working on establishing their chapter since last semester, and just received official student group recognition last week! They&#8217;ve already begun to work with the local NORML chapter on marijuana policy related events. Also, UPitt SSDP will be tabling at <a href="http://www.bassnectar.net/2010/12/041511-bassnectar-in-pittsburg-pa-at-ae-stage-indoors/">this Bassnectar show</a>as part of our <a href="http://ssdp.org/amplify">AMPLIFY project</a>.
