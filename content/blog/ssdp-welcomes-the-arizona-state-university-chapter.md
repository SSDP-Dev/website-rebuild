I&#8217;m so proud to welcome SSDP&#8217;s newest official chapter to the network, <a title="Arizona State University SSDP" href="http://ssdp.org/chapters/mountain-plains/arizona/arizona-state-university-asu/">Arizona State University</a>! I&#8217;ve been working with chapter leader and co-founder Chloe Antilla and it&#8217;s so great to see this chapter get off the ground! I spoke with Chloe about the chapter, what the experience has been like so far, and what the future holds for ASU SSDP;

<strong>How did you hear about SSDP?</strong>



<strong></strong>At the beginning of the fall semester I was searching for a club that would fulfill my interest in drug policy. When I started looking at the clubs offered at ASU I wasn&#8217;t finding anything that even came remotely close to what I was thinking. So I decided to ask my older brother what he thought I should do, and that&#8217;s when I found out about SSDP.

<img class="alignright size-full wp-image-5901" title="Arizona State University SSDP" src="/assets/2012/10/asu-thumb.png" alt="Arizona State University SSDP" width="150" height="150" /><strong>Why did you want to get involved/what made you decide to start a chapter?</strong>



I despise the hardwiring of this country, especially when it comes to the scheduling of drugs. The problems that arise from drug prohibition are much more detrimental than anyone &#8220;in charge&#8221; had anticipated. Of course, I&#8217;m preaching to the choir in this aspect. I also can&#8217;t tolerate ignorance when it comes to the TRUTH about drugs. I simply want to educate and  encourage reform.



&nbsp;



<strong>What has the reception been like on campus so far?</strong>



People often tend to think SSDP is against drug use altogether. I&#8217;m like no no no, we are against the war on drugs. We are against the prohibition of substances that have been deemed useful. <em>We are against ignorance, the wasting of resources, and the denial of a failed system. </em>



&nbsp;



<strong>What are some of the things you have planned or want to plan for the Fall 2012 and Spring 2013 semesters?</strong>

<div>This semester we are planning to first educate members and get them up to date with everything they should know. After, we are going to create a petition which will push for an equity policy regarding punishment of being caught with drugs versus alcohol on campus (opiates included). Basically we want the punishment for a kid caught with a doobie to be equal to a kid caught with vodka. The way things are now, the kid with the booze gets a slap on the wrist and maybe a ticket, whereas the kid with the doobie is going to be expelled and put on probation with a felony on his record.. which is not fair or logical in any aspect (especially when Arizona has medical marijuana patients). We will blow them away with stats and simple logic.</div>



&nbsp;

<strong>What is the most challenging part of your experience starting/running the chapter so far?</strong>



My greatest challenge is juggling it all, there are so many things to do when first starting a club so we&#8217;ve got to get everything organized before the revolution begins. Another challenge is getting the right group of people to the meetings. We don&#8217;t want lazy &#8220;stoners&#8221;. We want educated people who are passionate about reform.



&nbsp;



<strong>What is the most rewarding part?</strong>



<strong></strong>The most rewarding aspect of starting a club at the largest university in the nation is the fact that i have the ability to influence by the thousands. All i need is a loudspeaker and maybe a special guest appearance by Tommy Chong.



&nbsp;



<strong>What are you most excited about for your chapter right now?</strong>



Im most excited about getting kids involved and making us known by the community. I know there are other people who care about drug policy reform as deeply and as passionately as i do.. it&#8217;s just a matter of getting them to DO something about it. People think their opinion or voice doesnt matter. I want them to realize that it does! By getting them involved, they will witness the change and revolution.



&nbsp;



<strong>What is your vision for ASU SSDP? Where do you see your chapter in a year? in 4 or 5 years?</strong>



In 10 years, i want to see an ASU SSDP alumni in congress. I want to see the organization have more momentum than ever fathomed. I want to see current policies thrown out the window. I want to kickstart and witness the revolution.. because it will happen. it&#8217;s just a matter of time.
