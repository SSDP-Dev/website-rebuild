I&#8217;m very happy to write this blog post today. Over the past few months I&#8217;ve been working closely with Joseph Dosch of Mankato State University to set up an SSDP chapter on his campus. After a few weeks of paperwork and tabling, he has been officially recognized by the university. Please join me in welcoming the newest chapter to our network!

Joe is particularly interested in the potential of psychedelic therapy, and came to use after reading about the great work going on with the <a href="http://maps.org" target="_blank">Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies</a>Â and seeing their recommendation to start an SSDP chapter on his campus.

Recently, Joe and I have been talking about how to get a campaign on his campus up and running. His initial focus was on medical amnesty and good Samaritan policies. Fortunately, Mankato State University already has a solid GSP in place, and so his next steps an future vision is to get the school to provide comprehensive, science-based drug education to its students, as the current drug education courses are lacking.
