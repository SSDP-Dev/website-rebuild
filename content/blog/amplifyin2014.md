In 2008, I got involved with University of Maryland&#8217;s Student for Sensible Drug Policy and NORML chapter. From Fall of 2009-2010, I served as Vice President for University of Maryland&#8217;s NORML chapter. During then until the end of the Spring 2011 semester I helped planned events for University of Maryland SSDP and NORML chapter. One of my biggest accomplishments was throwing two Safe Raves at STAMP on University of Maryland&#8217;s campus. At the Safe Rave the University of Maryland chapter provided free water, and harm reduction information as a local DJ played. Spring of 2011 I was a intern at SSDP National&#8217;s office. After a little bit of a hiatus to focus on personal growth I am ecstatic to be working again in the field with AMPLIFY!</em><em>&#8220;</em>

<strong>Evan Eisenberg &#8211; Public Relations &amp; Social Media Coordinator</strong>

<em>“Evan Eisenberg first got involved with SSDP as a founding member of the University of South Florida chapter in Spring 2012. He was elected as the first chapter president, serving until Summer 2013 when he graduated with a degree in Sociology. Evan worked with Student Affairs administrators to pass a University Medical Amnesty Policy for USF System Campuses and was asked to write the first draft of the policy. Evan’s contributions to the Medical Amnesty campaign led administrators to create a position for him in the USF Wellness Center as an alcohol/other drug peer educator and general advisor to Wellness staff, focusing specifically on educating first-year students on alcohol and prescription drug use. Evan served as the only student member of USF’s Substance Education &amp; Awareness Team (SEAT), advising the group of staff, administrators, and police officers on issues like underage binge drinking and club drug harm reduction.</em>

<em>Evan has been involved with the AMPLIFY Project since shortly after starting an SSDP chapter, becoming a Regional Organizer for Florida in 2012, notably leading an AMPLIFY team at the historic Spirit of the Suwanee Music Park for the first time in AMPLIFY’s history, fittingly at Purple Hatter’s Ball, held in remembrance of Rachel Hoffman’s vibrant life and tragic death after being pressured into working as a confidential informant by Tallahassee PD. In addition to serving on AMPLIFY’s staff, Evan is one of nine elected student members of SSDP’s international board of directors. Evan has written influential articles on how asset forfeiture laws are used to wage war on festival culture as well as other topics related to drug policy reform and harm reduction. When not advocating for drug policy reform, providing direct-service harm reduction at live music events, or writing, Evan has worked with the Jacksonville Beach-based C4 Collective as a workshop leader. The C4 Collective is a family of like-minded people seeking to co-create sacred spaces at festivals for intellectual and spiritual development through sessions including guided meditation, yoga, and discussions on topics from permaculture ethics to drug policy reform. Live music and drug policy reform/harm reduction are Evan’s major passions and AMPLIFY has provided an outlet to explore this unique relationship between artists and activism.”</em>

It was not long after that he was first introduced to the AMPLIFY Project. As an avid concert goer the union of drug policy reform advocacy, harm reduction and the live music experience was nothing more than ideal. Since that introductory experience Trevor has represented The AMPLIFY Project at over thirty concerts and festivals around the country becoming our CO Regional Organizer in 2012. He is stepping up to handle artist &amp; volunteer outreach for some of our national artists in addition to helping in the creation of our brand new merchandise for 2014&#8221;</em>

<em>&#8220;Born in Northern VA, Kyle has resided in Richmond since 2010 and been involved with the VCU chapter Students for Sensible Drug Policy since 2011.

<h1>THANK YOU!!!</h1>
We achieved so much in 2013 and couldn&#8217;t have done ANY of it without the support of you all, our dedicated staff &amp; volunteers plus obviously the amazing partnered artists &amp; festivals that so graciously allow our presence at their events. 2014 is going to be a banner year for us without a doubt, to say we can&#8217;t wait to share our plans and see how things develop over these next few months would be the understatement of the century!

Be on the lookout for some major artist additions, new setups at festivals all over the country, the continuation of our on-going &#8220;Artist Interview Series&#8221;, brand new AMPLIFY merch, the announcement of our first international artists &amp; event setups in addition to a few more very special surprises&#8230; We can&#8217;t tell you everything right???
