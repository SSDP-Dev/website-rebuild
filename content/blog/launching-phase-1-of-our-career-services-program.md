<div>Since the day we announced I&#8217;d be the new executive director at SSDP, people have been asking me how they can tap into our amazing student network to find passionate, dedicated, proven new employees and interns. After a year of piloting and development, <strong>I&#8217;m <em>thrilled</em> to announce that phase 1 of our Career Services Program &#8212; <a href="http://ssdp.org/career-services-program/">the internship program</a> &#8212; is publicly launching</strong>!</div>

You know that Students for Sensible Drug Policy has, for nearly twenty years, held a unique space in the drug policy reform movement: The work that our members do on their campuses and in their states prepares them to be leaders in not only drug policy reform, but also in many intersecting movements. <a href="http://ssdp.org/alumni/where-our-alumni-work/">The list of SSDP alumni doing meaningful work</a> in social justice, the liberty movement, direct service harm reduction, and other areas of policy reform is long and impressive. State-legal marijuana industries have opened another door for post-graduation employment and many of the more visible leaders of that industry cut their teeth while founding SSDP and building their chapters.

<div>SSDP’s Career Services Program seeks to increase meaningful services to students and facilitate students’ increased engagement in policy reform &#8212; and the legal marijuana industry as one vector supporting that reform &#8212; through improved preparation for and access to post-graduation employment opportunities. The internship program is one way we do that. We match awesome SSDPers with employers, then guide both the SSDPer and the employer through a productive and mutually beneficial internship experience. We help with every aspect of intern management so you can focus on providing students with a rich experience and getting the most of their time with you.</div>
