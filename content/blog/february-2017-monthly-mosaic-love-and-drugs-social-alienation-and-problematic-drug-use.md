<span style="font-weight: 400;">In the 1980s, the Partnership for a Drug-Free America released a </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7kS72J5Nlm8"><span style="font-weight: 400;">television advertisement</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> showing a rat, alone, in a cage. The rat had been given two water bottles: one with plain water, and one laced with cocaine. “Only one drug is so addictive, nine out of ten laboratory rats will use it. And use it. And use it. Until dead. It’s called cocaine. And it can do the same thing to you,” </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7kS72J5Nlm8"><span style="font-weight: 400;">the ad claimed</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">This frightful propaganda was used to advance the narrative that drugs themselves are the cause of addiction, and that the only way to avoid a fate similar to the rat’s is to avoid drugs completely. But, is that really the case?</span>

<h2><b>Rat Park: How Social Alienation Feeds Problematic Drug Use</b></h2>
<a href="http://www.brucekalexander.com/articles-speeches/277-rise-and-fall-of-the-official-view-of-addiction-6"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bruce Alexander</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a professor of psychology in Vancouver, noticed that the rats in these experiments were being kept alone in cages. Surely, this had some impact, he reasoned, deciding to recreate the experiment in a way that would account for the isolation felt by the rats. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">In  Alexander’s experiment, all the  rats were initially forced to ingest morphine for a </span><a href="http://io9.gizmodo.com/the-rat-park-experiment-486168637"><span style="font-weight: 400;">month and a half</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Then, some of the rats were put alone in cages — recreating the conditions of the earlier experiment. The rest of the rats were placed together  in “Rat Park,” an enclosure with toys, exercise equipment, top-quality rat food, and walls painted to resemble a forest .</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The two groups of rats reacted very differently. </span><a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/johann-hari/the-real-cause-of-addicti_b_6506936.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">While all the isolated rats became heavy drug users, none of the rats in Rat Park did</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. In fact, </span><a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/johann-hari/the-real-cause-of-addicti_b_6506936.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">the Rat Park residents voluntarily used less than a quarter of the drugged water used by their caged counterparts</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Alexander then ran another test. The isolated rats were allowed to become compulsive users of the drugged water for 57 days, before being placed in the Rat Park environment. Strikingly, </span><a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/johann-hari/the-real-cause-of-addicti_b_6506936.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">after a short period of withdrawal, the addicted rats were able to heal from their problematic use of the drug, and went back to living normal lives</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Professor Peter Cohen of the Netherlands who </span><a href="http://www.cedro-uva.org/cohen/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">entered the field of drug research in 1980</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, proposes that </span><a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/johann-hari/the-real-cause-of-addicti_b_6506936.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">the cause of addiction is not solely the chemical properties of drugs taking over the human brain and body</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. If that were true, then how can humans be similarly addicted to shopping, gambling, pornography, and other non-ingested things? Instead, </span><a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/johann-hari/the-real-cause-of-addicti_b_6506936.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cohen believes that addiction is more like searching for a bond</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, part of human nature. </span><a href="http://www.ted.com/talks/johann_hari_everything_you_think_you_know_about_addiction_is_wrong/transcript?language=en"><span style="font-weight: 400;">If one is unable to live a happy and healthy life bonding with others, they will look to bond with something else that will give them relief. </span></a>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The bottom line is that </span><a href="http://www.ted.com/talks/johann_hari_everything_you_think_you_know_about_addiction_is_wrong/transcript?language=en"><span style="font-weight: 400;">humans need connection and love to thrive</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, meaning that attempting to solve problems associated with problematic drug use with fear tactics like locking people in jail cells and taking them away from their homes and families is the wrong approach.</span>

<h2><b>Trans Marginalization and Problematic Drug Use</b></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">People from marginalized communities may not have a strong base of social support, which can put them at risk for harmful drug use. </span>

<a href="/?p=17228"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Transgender individuals</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, for example, are </span><a href="http://www.transequality.org/sites/default/files/docs/usts/USTS%20Full%20Report%20-%20FINAL%201.6.17.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;">more likely than the general population to be rejected by their families, kicked out of the house, experience physical and verbal harassment at school and work, and live in poverty or experience homelessness</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. These risks are compounded for transgender people of color, or transgender people who are disabled, undocumented, or non-male. </span><a href="/?p=17228"><span style="font-weight: 400;">This hardship and trauma may be a reason that transgender people are more likely to use drugs</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and experience </span><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/msmhealth/substance-abuse.htm"><span style="font-weight: 400;">higher rates of substance abuse</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> than the general population. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Unfortunately, from a historical perspective, </span><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3889182/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">substance abuse treatment was developed for adult heterosexual men without regard to non-normative sexuality, gender, age and cultural considerations</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">In a survey of 27,715 transgender individuals, </span><a href="http://www.transequality.org/sites/default/files/docs/USTS-Executive-Summary-FINAL.PDF"><span style="font-weight: 400;">33% had negative experiences when seeking health care</span></a> <span style="font-weight: 400;">“such as being verbally harassed or refused treatment because of their gender identity,” and</span> <a href="http://www.transequality.org/sites/default/files/docs/USTS-Executive-Summary-FINAL.PDF"><span style="font-weight: 400;">23% reported that they “did not seek the health care they needed due to fear of being mistreated as a transgender person.” </span></a>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Love and support from family, friends, and the community might be an important factor in keeping transgender people and others from marginalized communities safe  — </span><a href="http://www.transequality.org/sites/default/files/docs/USTS-Executive-Summary-FINAL.PDF"><span style="font-weight: 400;">54% of trans individuals whose immediate families were unsupportive had attempted suicide in their lifetime, compared to 37% whose families were supportive.</span></a>

<i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The </span></i><a href="/?p=17228"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">November 2015 issue of the </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Monthly Mosaic</span></a><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> takes a deeper dive into the many ways in which </span></i><a href="/?p=17228"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">trans people are disproportionately impacted by the war on drugs. </span></i></a>

<hr />

<h2><b>Drug Use v.s. Drug Abuse</b></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Often, government rhetoric and popular media  refer to all drug </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">use</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> as drug </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">abuse, </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">lumping the two as if no distinction is warranted, and a disproportionate number of studies focus on problematic — as opposed to non-problematic — drug use. </span>

<a href="http://www.asam.org/docs/default-source/public-policy-statements/1-terminology-spectrum-sud-7-13.pdf?sfvrsn=2"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Drug use falls on a spectrum</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> , and </span><a href="http://alcoholrehab.com/drug-addiction/continuum-of-substance-use-and-abuse/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">the majority of drug users do not have unhealthy relationships with the substances they use</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. People who have problematic drug use need </span><a href="http://www.drugpolicy.org/blog/how-should-our-society-deal-people-who-use-drugs"><span style="font-weight: 400;">compassion and treatment</span></a> <span style="font-weight: 400;">— but</span> <a href="http://www.drugpolicy.org/blog/how-should-our-society-deal-people-who-use-drugs"><span style="font-weight: 400;">it is also important that those who do not want or need drug treatment not be forced into it</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span>
