<a href="https://conference.ssdp.org/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">SSDP 2018</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is just about 10 days away, and </span><b>15</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> amazing SSDPers have applied to run for the </span><a href="http://ssdp.org/about/board/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Board of Directors</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. SSDP is governed by a Board of Directors, which is made up of student members &#8211; elected by SSDP chapters during SSDP’s annual Congress &#8211; and appointed alumni. All are volunteers and each member serves a two-year term. Directors are expected to fundraise $1,000 annually to contribute to the organization.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Some of the Board’s responsibilities include: crafting </span><a href="http://ssdp.org/strategy/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">strategy for the organization</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, monitoring compliance and financial affairs, overseeing SSDP’s Executive Director, planning the annual SSDP Strategy Summit, and preparing Congress. Each member serves on various Board committees that range from international outreach to fundraising. If you’re interested in looking at the bylaws, check them out</span><a href="https://ssdp.org/bylaws/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">here</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">This year, fifteen candidates are running for six spots on the Board. Candidates come from chapters all across the United States, Mexico, Nigeria, and Sierra Leone. The first Congress session begins at </span><b>8pm on Friday, March 2 </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">at the annual conference in Baltimore. Candidates will answer questions about their fitness for the Board – answering questions on their leadership capacity, fundraising capability, all in front of their SSDP peers. Before the conference, be sure to check out the </span><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1BegY2K3ytlZ0-jP1UIaGQ8vI0CAD1kF0q16tjfOv8N0/edit"><span style="font-weight: 400;">candidate applications</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (or if you’re in a rush, the </span><a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Pc5k-TD6Ah8qzrAX86wFlqr-redQ19Lpn9Zf3f4CS7E/edit#slide=id.g1ce5b4ea06_0_6"><span style="font-weight: 400;">candidate highlights</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">).</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The second Congress session will be held at </span><b>1:15pm on Saturday, March 3</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, during the conference lunch break. This is when voting takes place. Each chapter will have one vote and will get to rank their top six candidates for the Board of Directors. Chapters not in attendance can cast their votes online. During this session, chapters will also have a chance to vote on resolutions submitted by fellow chapters.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Election results for the Board of Directors will be announced at the Awards Ceremony, Saturday night at 8pm. In addition to the six newly elected Board members, two alternates will be selected in the case that a Board member resigns or otherwise becomes vacant. </span>
