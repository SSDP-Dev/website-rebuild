This morning, Delaware Governor Jack Markel <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/national/delaware-governor-signs-bill-making-it-the-16th-state-to-legalize-medical-marijuana/2011/05/13/AF7BEd2G_story.html" target="_blank">signed the state&#8217;s medical marijuana bill into law</a>, making Delaware the <a href="http://www.wdel.com/story.php?id=34605" target="_blank">16th state to have legalized</a> the use of marijuana for medical purposes.

<blockquote>The bill received final legislative approval Wednesday. A spokesman said Markell wanted to sign the measure as quickly as possible because of the lengthy time that will be needed to get a state-run system for distributing medical marijuana up and running.



The new law allows people 18 and older with certain serious or debilitating conditions that could be alleviated by marijuana to possess up to six ounces of the drug. Qualifying patients would be referred to state-licensed and regulated “compassion centers,” which would be located in each of Delaware’s three counties. The centers would grow, cultivate and dispense the marijuana.</blockquote>

Congratulations to Delaware for implementing sensible policy! Now we&#8217;ll just have to wait and see if Gov. Markel gets a threatening letter from the DoJ&#8230;
