Daniel Jabbour, an SSDP all-star alumnus, passed away in April of this year. To honor and remember him, SSDP created this scholarship fund to send an outstanding activist to the <a href="http://ssdp.org/events/2014-conference-lobby-day/">2014 Students for Sensible Drug Policy Conference and Lobby Day</a>.

Daniel&#8217;s driving passions in drug policy reform were psychedelics and harm reduction, leading him to found the <a href="http://psychedelicsf.org/">Psychedelic Society of San Francisco</a>. Much like SSDP, the Psychedelic Society created a safe space for people to discuss their experiences, expand their knowledge, and work to change the status quo. This scholarship will be awarded to someone who has exhibited their dedication to education and policy reform around psychedelics and/or harm reduction.
