<span style="font-weight: 400;">Earlier today, US Attorney General Jeff Sessions </span><a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/press-release/file/1022196/download"><span style="font-weight: 400;">rescinded the set of memos</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that cannabis reformers have counted on to protect the will of the voters in 29 states where cannabis has been legalized for medical or adult use. Sessions has spent his career demonizing marijuana and the people who use it. Now he wields the power of the Department of Justice to enact his prohibitionist vision in direct contradiction to the will of voters. This isn’t just an attack on cannabis reforms &#8212; this is an attack on civil liberty, state economies, racial justice, and vulnerable patients. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">There’s one thing that can stop him in his tracks: Congress must end marijuana prohibition. In the meantime, some protections are afforded by the Rohrabacher-Blumenauer amendment. In place since 2014, the amendment prohibits the DOJ from prosecuting state-legal medical marijuana activities, and without it they’d be free to target cannabis consumers, workers, businesses, and regulators. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Sessions wrong-headed approach has already been </span><a href="https://www.marijuanamoment.net/lawmakers-react-sessions-anti-marijuana-move/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">condemned</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by elected officials and decision makers from across the political spectrum. In just about 7 minutes, you can defend the progress we’ve made by letting your Representative and Senators know that we expect them to stand with their states against this federal intrusion. </span>
<h2><b>Congress needs to hear us today!</b></h2>
<h3><a href="https://www.house.gov/representatives/find-your-representative"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Call your Representative</span></a></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">“Hi, my name is _________ and I’m a constituent who lives in _________. I’m calling because I believe marijuana should be legal and safely accessible. Will Representative _________ make sure the Rohrabacher-Blumenauer amendment protecting state-legal medical marijuana is in the upcoming budget bill?”</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">If yes: “Thank you! Please tell the Representative that I stand with them and encourage them to make marijuana federally legal.”</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">If no: “Seven of ten voters believe the federal government should let states manage marijuana without interference, The Rohrabacher-Blumenauer amendment provides critical protection to state-legal medical marijuana and the critically ill patients who rely on it. I urge the Representative to support the will of the voters and vote for the Rohrabacher-Blumenauer amendment.”</span>
<h3><a href="https://www.senate.gov/general/contact_information/senators_cfm.cfm"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Call your Senator</span></a></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">“Hi, my name is _________ and I’m a constituent who lives in _________. I’m calling because I believe marijuana should be legal and safely accessible.
