<h3><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #fab032;">Introduction</span></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Content warning: ableism, medication shaming, mentions of suicide</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Disabled people represent one of the largest, yet most underrepresented marginalized groups. </span><a href="http://www.un.org/disabilities/documents/toolaction/pwdfs.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Around 10% of the world&#8217;s population, or 650 million people, live with a disability</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span>

Many disabled people continue to fight for equal rights and access to vital medications, despite facing barriers like immense physical pain, very limited energy, constant illness, and other obstacles. However, <a href="https://www.autostraddle.com/be-the-change-six-disabled-activists-on-why-the-resistance-must-be-accessible-368956/">the disabled community struggles to be seen and heard due to accessibility issues that persist in many activist and political spaces.</a>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Because many abled people have so little experience with real disabled people, sometimes abled people misunderstand their needs and the core issues they face. This can result in abled people unintentionally perpetuating misunderstandings and misinformation when they attempt to advocate for the disabled community.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">People with disabilities experience a whole side of the War on Drugs that abled people do not see, and that information is crucially important to crafting good drug policies.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">This issue of </span><a href="https://ssdp.org/dare/monthlymosaic/"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The SSDP Mosaic</span></i></a> <span style="font-weight: 400;">will introduce you to the issues disabled people face in activist spaces and discuss some of the ways in which the War on Drugs deeply impacts disabled people’s day-to-day lives.

<h3><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #fab032;">Are Drug Policy and Reform Communities Failing the Disability Community?</span></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Nearly </span><a href="https://www.census.gov/newsroom/releases/archives/miscellaneous/cb12-134.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">1 in 5 Americans</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> — 20-25% of the U.S. population — have a disability, and people with disabilities take part in drug use at </span><a href="https://www.addiction.com/3007/living-disability-increases-risk-substance-abuse/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">two to four times</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the rate of the general population. Disabled people who use drugs associated with dependence are also more likely to have difficulty in stopping if they choose to do so, especially those with disabilities such as intellectual/developmental disabilities. The 7–8 million people in the U.S. with an intellectual disability suffer disproportionately from substance use problems, largely because of a </span><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3328139/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">lack of empirical evidence to inform prevention and treatment efforts for them.</span></a>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Yet, many abled people — usually because of a lack of education on the matter — do not think of people with disabilities when thinking of the communities of people who use drugs, and, as a result, they are not always included in the drug policy reform conversation.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Do you regularly find harm reduction flyers and materials in braille? Do you know how to help someone with autism and sensory processing issues who is having a bad psychedelic experience? Do your peer support efforts for drug use at festivals ensuring have ASL interpreters at the ready? Are the needle/syringe exchange programs in your area located in wheelchair accessible places that meet ADA guidelines?</span>

<a href="http://cdrnys.org/blog/uncategorized/ableism/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The lack of effort to include disabled people is a form of ableism</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which means discrimination (whether intentional or accidental) against disabled people. Like other often unconscious biases, </span><a href="http://cdrnys.org/blog/uncategorized/ableism/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">ableism is intertwined in our culture</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and can result in, sometimes unconscious, negative attitudes around disability. Understandably, it can be very difficult for disabled people to feel integrated into an activist community when they feel they always have to be ready to defend themselves and their needs, so an environment that condones ableist comments and attitudes can severely disincentivize involvement.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Lack of accessibility </span><a href="https://themighty.com/2017/02/the-importance-of-disability-accessibility-at-activist-events/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">alienates disabled people and creates further barriers to their participation</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The drug policy reform movement needs to do better in proactively including disabled people —  including, amongst others, the deaf and hard of hearing community, low vision and blind communities, wheelchair users, and chronically ill people. Event and conference locations may have physical barriers that prevent wheelchair users, and others with limited mobility, from participating. These include a lack of  working accessible elevators, accessible restrooms, ramps, flat entrances, accessible seating sections, and walkways that are wide enough for a wheelchair. Without services like ASL interpreters, wheelchair accessibility, and braille informational pamphlets/handouts, many disabled people find themselves in a catch-22 situation where they are unable to advocate for what they need in order to be better drug policy reform advocates.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">One key cause of this oversight is cost. Funds can be scarce in non-profit organizing and organizers often don’t want to spend  their limited budget on pricey accessibility services when they don’t know if people with those particular disabilities will be in attendance. They instead rely on people with disabilities giving enough advance notice that they can be accommodated. While this sounds like a good solution, disabled people often have to plan extensively for almost every daily activity abled people take for granted. Deciding to attend an event last minute is a luxury people with disabilities do not get in an inaccessible world, making it harder for them to access services like needle exchanges or life-saving drugs. As a bare </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">minimum, organizers should make every effort to ensure spaces are wheelchair accessible and can easily be adapted for additional accommodations. Rockstar activists will also </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">create a plan for providing all accessibility measures for big events; promotion of the event should publicize that these services will be made available upon request and include reliable contact information.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400; color: #136f8d;">Leslie’s Experience</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The reason I got involved with drug policy is because I saw many of my disabled friends I grew up with — people I knew from special education, testing accommodations, or disability support groups — die from overdose. We want naloxone, we want supervised injection clinics, we want decriminalization and legalization — just like the rest of you.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400; color: #136f8d;">Alex’s Experience</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a wheelchair user with organ failure, the biggest accessibility issue I have had has been with an officer in my SSDP chapter. He would criticize the amount of pain medication I had to be on and often tried to tell me I needed to stop my life saving treatments because he thought his natural supplements would magically cure me. Last semester,  the AIrBnB my chapter stayed in for the regional conference was inaccessible to me. So, this officer decided — without looking into it at all — that I couldn’t go to the national conference because I’m disabled, and that, if I went, I’d have to go completely separate from my chapter. When our chapter’s leader found out about what had been done, she apologized and tried to make arrangements so I could attend, but with the extensive amount of planning that has to go into traveling with my condition, we couldn’t make it happen.
</span>

<h3><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #fab032;">Opioids and Disability</span></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Many disabilities are chronic illnesses which require treatment regimens that include prescription medication, which can be vital for  daily functioning, symptom management, and maintaining quality of life. When a substance becomes scheduled, it adds barriers for disabled and sick people who need that treatment option. Restrictions placed on those drugs cause serious complications for disabled people and generally cause this poverty-prone demographic to have to pay significantly more money for specialists and medications.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Recently, we have seen pushes both on the federal and state levels to limit the prescribing and dispensing of opioids. This kind of legislation is being supported across the political spectrum by well-meaning people seeking to prevent unhealthy substance use, without looking at the actual impact these policies have. The DEA, which sets national manufacturing quotas for opioids, </span><a href="https://www.cato.org/blog/hospitalized-patients-are-civilian-casualties-governments-war-opioids"><span style="font-weight: 400;">ordered a 25% reduction in 2017 &amp; 20% again this year</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a result, trauma patients, post-surgical patients, and hospitalized cancer patients frequently go undertreated for excruciating pain.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The CDC for the most part </span><a href="https://www.ncnp.org/journal-of-medicine/1929-doctors-fleeing-pain-management-dumping-patients.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">ignored the input of expert pain management specialists as they developed their guidelines on opioid prescription for chronic pain, and even violated the CDC’s own research protocols</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, in what appears to have been an effort to bias the outcomes of their work against the use of prescription pain relievers. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">This politically-driven policy shift has lead to </span><a href="https://www.ncnp.org/journal-of-medicine/1929-doctors-fleeing-pain-management-dumping-patients.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">tens of thousands of chronic pain patients having proven and essential pain medications arbitrarily reduced or outright withdrawn by doctors afraid of DEA prosecution</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Meanwhile, doctors are leaving pain management by the droves, often “dumping” </span><a href="https://www.ncnp.org/journal-of-medicine/1929-doctors-fleeing-pain-management-dumping-patients.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">hundreds of pain patients without referral to another doctor</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">According to a recent survey </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">on the impact of the CDC&#8217;s opioid prescribing guidelines,  </span><a href="https://www.painnewsnetwork.org/2017-cdc-survey/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">71.13% of of pain patients have had their dose reduced, and about one third have been totally cut off</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.  Without medication people lose varying amounts of ability. For some, they slowly are able to do less each day, while others may be unable to work or care for themselves. This loss of independence can be devastating — </span><a href="https://www.painnewsnetwork.org/2017-cdc-survey/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">84% reported a lower quality of life and 42% reported considering suicide</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> because of the severity of their pain. Understandably, pain patients who have been cut off from treatment often try to find new doctors from the ever shrinking pool of available professionals. When they are unable to find help, </span><a href="https://www.painnewsnetwork.org/2017-cdc-survey/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">some suffer in silence, others turn to self medicating (11%), and some turn to hospice or suicide</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to escape what seems like unending agony. This is particularly tragic considering a simple prescription could improve their quality of life dramatically.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="color: #136f8d;">Alex’s Experience</span>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once my organ failure became life threatening, I was agony constantly. Before even trying heavier opioids, a doctor told me to end my life because according to her, they only prescribe opioids for people with cancer now. She said I was destined to be miserable as I was in so much pain I often struggled to sit up on my own.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">After moving to a bigger city to get better care, I found a palliative care and hospice doctor who was willing to prescribe to me, only to have her to resign out of fear of DEA prosecution.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Now, I’m with another palliative care and hospice practitioner who has saved my life by putting me on a high enough dose of fentanyl that I can now take care of myself rather than continuing to be bedbound.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The scary thing is that I almost died before I got this care; I spent over a year suffering, requiring around-the-clock care and unable to leave my home. All that time, I could have been able to fight my organ failure so much better if I had access to the medicine I do now. It’s even more terrifying that, due to DEA pressure, I could again end up without the medications that I know save my quality of life, forcing me to go back into hospice care.
</span>

<h3><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #fab032;">“Pill Shaming” is Real and Harmful</span></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Stigma around medications like amphetamines, benzodiazepines, opioids, medical cannabis, ect., leads people to be afraid to seek treatment and pressures doctors to limit prescriptions. Unfortunately, many people still hold </span><a href="https://themighty.com/2016/02/myths-about-mental-illness-medication/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">negative views of those who rely on regular medication</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> — even in cases where prescription medication is the most effective available treatment. Many in the disability community report being pressured by family and friends — and even strangers — to switch to “more natural” alternative treatments, even in cases where there is no evidence of that alternative treatment working for their conditions. This can result in patients using medications extremely sparingly (</span><a href="http://www.slate.com/articles/health_and_science/medical_examiner/2017/08/cutting_down_on_opioids_has_made_life_miserable_for_chronic_pain_patients.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">undermedicating can lead to worsening of medical conditions</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">) or even ceasing treatment altogether. The most harmful stigma, though, is that held by medical professionals — which is now being worsened by the </span><a href="http://www.slate.com/articles/health_and_science/medical_examiner/2017/08/cutting_down_on_opioids_has_made_life_miserable_for_chronic_pain_patients.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">threat of prosecution faced by medical providers accused of “overprescribing” or running  “pill mills.”</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Nurses will block referrals, pharmacists will refuse to fill some prescriptions, and doctors will turn patients with hard-to control-symptoms away.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="color: #136f8d;">Leslie’s Experience</span>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">I often cringe when I hear someone mention “big pharma.” Not that I don’t agree big pharma is an issue and has its faults, but many times these rants become ableist, attacking people who take the medications “big pharma” has produced. One of the biggest examples of this is when people talk about “overmedication.”</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">I have been taking medication for my ADHD since I was 7 years old. This is usually where people respond poorly. If you go back and look at all my Facebook posts about medication, you will always see someone declare I’m overmedicated, inadvertently shaming me and anyone who dares to buy into “big pharma&#8217;s plot to medicate the entire human population!” Sometimes, the commenters even go on about how ADHD was made up by the pharmaceutical industry, and that I don’t need the medication that helps me function in a society that wasn’t built for people like me (just in case you are wondering, ADHD is indeed a real thing).</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Without my meds, I would fail classes because I wouldn&#8217;t be able to focus or get my work done due to the 400 thoughts constantly running through my mind all at once. Without medication, I say things that get me in trouble because I am moving quicker than my brain can follow; I&#8217;m acting before I think. I can&#8217;t even drive a car safely without my medication because I can&#8217;t concentrate on what I&#8217;m doing and end up daydreaming. I lack executive skills and my medication helps me compensate for my differently wired brain. Being medicated was the greatest thing that has ever happened to me, because it allowed me to succeed in a society that isn’t built for those with ADHD and other disabilities.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Many times medication-shaming rants stem from bad experiences with medications. Those experience are completely valid. But, it becomes problematic when people use their bad experiences with a medication to declare that a medication is not good for anyone to use. This can translate into a person claiming that medication is something “big pharma” is trying to harm you with, and shaming other people for being medicated.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The issue is that medication doesn’t affect everyone in the same way because we are all wired differently. Prozac was one of the worst experiences for me. It made me sick, extremely loopy, and just not me. I hated it and was relieved to get off it. When my best friend went to the psychiatrist a year later, the doctor prescribed Prozac to her. She came to me asking what my thoughts were, and I said, “Try it.” Even though Prozac was one of the most miserable experiences I have ever had with a medication, I know that she isn’t me and that this medication has helped millions of people. Turns out, it was the single greatest thing she has ever taken. She went from being suicidal to being able to manage her depression and anxiety. Her grades started getting better and she went from a 2.9 average to graduating with a 3.6 — all because she was able to find a medication that worked for her.
