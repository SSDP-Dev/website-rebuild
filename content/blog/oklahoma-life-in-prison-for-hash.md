<img class="alignright" src="http://ssdp.org/assets/images/blog/2011/may/prison-bars2[1].jpg" alt="Life in Prison for Hash in Oklahoma" width="320" height="240" />You read that correctly. The Oklahoma legislature just passed a bill that would make manufacturing hash a felony punishable by life in prison.

Sadly, <a href="http://stopthedrugwar.org/chronicle/2011/apr/22/oklahoma_senate_passes_life_sent">the bill met little to no opposition</a> and is now awaiting the signature of Governor Mary Falin:

The measure sailed through the Senate with little debate, passing on a vote of 44-2. The House also approved the measure by a large margin, passing it on a vote of 75-18.

The bill, <a href="http://newlsb.lsb.state.ok.us/BillInfo.aspx?Bill=hb1798">House Bill 1798</a>, creates a new felony of converting marijuana into hash. A first conviction could garner a $50,000 fine and prison sentence of two years to life. And that&#8217;s a mandatory minimum two years. Second or subsequent convictions would net doubled penalties.

Dan Riffe at the Marijuana Policy Project <a href="http://blog.mpp.org/prohibition/life-sentence-in-oklahoma-for-making-hash/04292011/">points out just how absurd</a> this new law is:

Here are some other crimes and their maximum punishments under Oklahoma law:
<ul>
	<li>Domestic abuse = 1 year</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li>Drinking and driving with a child in the car = 4 years</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li>Aggravated assault resulting in &#8220;great physical injury&#8221; = 5 years</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li>Assault with intent to kill = 5 years</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li>Kidnapping a child = 5 years</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li>Second degree rape = 15 years</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li>Sexual battery of a child = 20 years</li>
</ul>
&nbsp;

If you&#8217;re a citizen of Oklahoma, <a href="https://secure2.convio.net/mpp/site/Advocacy?cmd=display&amp;page=UserAction&amp;id=875">contact Gov. Falin today</a> and tell her to veto this bad bill.
