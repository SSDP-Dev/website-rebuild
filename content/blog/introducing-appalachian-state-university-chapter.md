<span style="font-weight: 400">The War on Drugs is a war on us, our friends, and our families. To many of us, SSDP is the vehicle through which we end these senseless atrocities and unnecessary pain caused by the prohibition. That is why when Victor told me that he wanted to start a chapter at Appalachian State University, I knew SSDP would be a good fit. Currently studying guitar performance and pre-med, Victor found SSDP through a friend. He had lost a brother to a drug-related incident, and he strongly believes that education is a powerful factor in curving the issues surrounding drugs and drug policy. Like many of us, too, Victor sees a lot of his peers using drugs but little to no serious conversation about how they can be safe and have fun. Through SSDP, Victor hopes to create a safe space where people can discuss drugs and drug use in an open, honest, and rational manner. Please join me in welcoming Victor and the Appalachian State University chapter to our network!</span>
