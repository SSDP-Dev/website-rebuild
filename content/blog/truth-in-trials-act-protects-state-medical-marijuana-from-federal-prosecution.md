Since 1970, the federal government has refused to recognize the medical value of marijuana. Marijuana is still a schedule one substance in their eyes, and so they have the &#8220;authority&#8221; to enforce their laws, even in medical marijuana states &#8211; states who voted for and who want medical marijuana.



What does this mean? Let&#8217;s say you live in a medical marijuana state. You have obtained your medical marijuana card through the correct, legal, and legitimate channels and you&#8217;re in total compliance with your state&#8217;s laws regarding medical marijuana. If you get arrested and are facing federal charges for marijuana cultivation, for example, you are not allowed to use your state&#8217;s medical marijuana laws as a defense.Â <em>It doesn&#8217;t matter if it&#8217;s legal in Colorado, it&#8217;s illegal under federal law.</em>



On July 17, Representative Farr (D-CA), and 18 co-sponsors, introduced <a title="Truth in Trials Act" href="http://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/112/hr6134" target="_blank">HR 6134, The Truth in Trials Act</a>, which would fix this problem and allow people tried in federal court for marijuana related offenses to call upon evidence that they were in compliance with their state&#8217;s medical marijuana laws. <em>It doesn&#8217;t matter if it&#8217;s illegal under federal law, you&#8217;re protected under Colorado law.</em>



&nbsp;

<blockquote>(a) Any person facing prosecution or a proceeding for any marijuana-related offense under any Federal law shall have the right to introduce evidence demonstrating that the marijuana-related activities for which the person stands accused were performed in compliance with State law regarding the medical use of marijuana, or that the property which is subject to a proceeding was possessed in compliance with State law regarding the medical use of marijuana.



&nbsp;



(b)(1) It is an affirmative defense to a prosecution or proceeding under any Federal law for marijuana-related activities, which the proponent must establish by a preponderance of the evidence, that those activities comply with State law regarding the medical use of marijuana</blockquote>

&nbsp;



We are slowly unraveling the behemoth mess that is prohibition and this bill is a crucial step, stopping all of the needless, costly, and harmful federal crackdowns in states who voted for and who overwhelmingly want medical marijuana.
