<p style="text-align: left">Meet Olympia Karageorgieou and Josh Shumate, the Chapter President and Vice President of the <a href="http://ssdp.org/chapters/southeast/alabama/university-of-alabama/" target="_blank">University of Alabama SSDP chapter</a>. Olympia and Josh have already been making waves during their first semester on campus. They were able to leverage their relationships with the Student Government Association to pass a medical amnesty resolution, sparking a meeting with campus administration to pursue the policy change, before even becoming an officially recognized student organization. Now that they have been officially recognized by the University, they are dedicated to continuing to work with campus administration to enact a medical amnesty policy and have also begun talks with the administration about campus-level Naloxone training and access.</p>
Olympia and Josh are also very dedicated to beginning a dialogue on campus about two other drug policy related issues that are of particular importance on their campus: student drug testing and the use of University students as undercover informants by local &amp; state law enforcement agencies.

Based on what I have seen so far, Olympia and Josh are well on the way to building the type of chapter we have seen in recent years in the southeast region, typified by effective campaigns to successfully change campus policy and to engage in awareness-raising which reverberates beyond campus and into the surrounding community.
