Here at SSDP, we&#8217;re serious about being a grassroots organization. We asked you to submit ideas for sessions or topics you&#8217;d like to see at our next conference, <a href="http://ssdp.org/events/ssdp2016/">SSDP2016</a>. Now we&#8217;re taking that a step further by inviting SSDP students to vote on your favorites! <a href="https://docs.google.com/a/ssdp.org/forms/d/1EuN1QuyzAHPhPdYJGRaW6BBPzW-RYtRQzMPBYeDE1zg/viewform">Voting is only open for a few days, so don&#8217;t miss your chance to cast your vote.</a> <strong>Deadline is 11:59pm PST Thursday, February 11.Â </strong>

Here&#8217;s a little more about how this will work:
<blockquote>SSDP students are invited to vote on session proposals submitted for SSDP2016. Rate each session idea on a scale of 0-10 based on how much you are interested in seeing it become a session at SSDP2016.

&nbsp;

You&#8217;ll notice that you must be logged in in order to vote. This is to ensure each person only votes once. Your email will be recorded, but it will not be shared and will not be associated with your responses.

&nbsp;

Please keep in mind that this information came directly from submissions and have not been edited. Final selections will be refined substantially, so try to evaluate these based on the broad idea of the suggestion.</blockquote>
<a href="https://docs.google.com/a/ssdp.org/forms/d/1EuN1QuyzAHPhPdYJGRaW6BBPzW-RYtRQzMPBYeDE1zg/viewform">Cast your vote for SSDP2016 sessions today!</a>
