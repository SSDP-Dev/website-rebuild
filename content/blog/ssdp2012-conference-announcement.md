Good news!  Today was the original deadline to register for <a href="http://ssdp.org/conference">SSDP2012: The 13th Annual International Students for Sensible Drug Policy Conference</a>, but we have decided to extend the deadline until Friday, March 9, 2012.  <a href="http://ssdp.org/events/2012-national-ssdp-conference/registration">Register here</a> to join hundreds of others who will be with us in Denver later this month.  <em>(Please Note: After March 9th, you will no longer be able to register online.  The only remaining option will be to register in person at the conference, and registration fees will be significantly increased.)</em>



<a href="http://ssdp.org/news/blog/whats-in-store-for-ssdp2012">Recently</a>, we announced many of the breakout sessions, and in addition to those, the conference will include keynote speeches from:

<ul>

	<li>Ethan Nadelmann &#8211; Executive Director, Drug Policy Alliance</li>

	<li>Rick Doblin, Executive Director, Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies</li>

	<li>Kris Krane &#8211; Former Executive Director, Students for Sensible Drug Policy</li>

	<li>Adam Smith &#8211; Co-Founder, Students for Sensible Drug Policy</li>

</ul>

We&#8217;ll also have a story booth where conference participants can come record short videos of each other telling stories about how or why they got involved in ending the war on drugs.  Also, we will celebrate outstanding achievements during Saturday&#8217;s award ceremony and concert.  <a href="http://ssdp.org/events/2012-national-ssdp-conference/schedule">Check out what else is in store on our tentative conference schedule</a>.
