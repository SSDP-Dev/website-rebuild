SSDP is extremely excited to announce that we will be partnering with our friends at <a href="http://maps.org/">MAPS</a> for the upcoming <a href="http://www.maps.org/conference/">Psychedelic Science conference</a> this April.



SSDP staff members will be at the conference talking to interested students, alumni, and supporters who share our mutual interest in changing drug policy surrounding psychedelic substance research and therapy. Additionally, MAPS has graciously extended their student discount to all current SSDP students until April 1st, 2013. This means that you can get your ticket for only $200, which is less than half of the standard registration price. To access the discount, students must send a photo of their current student ID to <a href="mailto:tess@maps.org" target="_blank">tess@maps.org</a>, who will follow up with registration and payment details.



You don&#8217;t want to miss out on this opportunity to attend the largest gathering of scientists, researchers, reformers, and other members of the psychedelic research community. Conference presenters come from the worldʼs leading universities—including Johns Hopkins, University of California Los Angeles, University of California San Francisco, Purdue University, University of São Paulo (Brazil), Pompeu Fabra University (Barcelona), Heidelberg University (Germany) Hannover Medical School (Germany), University of Zürich (Switzerland), University of British Colombia (Canada), University of Toronto (Canada), and many others—as well as from leading independent research institutes. Many researchers are accomplished authors, publishers, and speakers.



If you have any questions about Psychedelic Science 2013, MAPS, or our special discount, please contact SSDP Outreach Director, <a href="http://ssdp.org/about/staff/devon-tackels/">Devon Tackels</a> today.
