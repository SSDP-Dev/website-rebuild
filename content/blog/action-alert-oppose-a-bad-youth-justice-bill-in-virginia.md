A bill (<a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?121+sum+HB718">HB 718</a>) that would make it easier to try youth as adults and greatly expand the number of youth tried as adults is moving swiftly through the Virginia House of Delegates.  Our best chance to stop it will be to block the Virginia Senate version, <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?121+sum+SB419">SB 419</a>.  It will probably be heard next week in the Senate Courts of Justice Committee.  It is important for these legislators to hear from juvenile defense attorneys and others who know how juvenile transfer/certification REALLY works and the problems associated with this practice.  Keep reading for several ways you can take action to oppose this bill!



If you are represented by one of the key Virginia state senators* listed below, please call them THIS WEEK and tell them:



<strong>&#8220;As your constituent, I ask you to oppose SB 419, which would result in more kids being tried as adults.  Youth crime rates are dropping, so this bill is unnecessary, and it&#8217;s expensive.&#8221; </strong>



If you have a story that highlights the problems associated with transfer/certification, explain it briefly.  Then please share this alert with anyone you know who is also represented by these senators.  If you can recruit 5 or more people to call, it will really make a difference!
