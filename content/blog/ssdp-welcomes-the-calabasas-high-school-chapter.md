Meet Adison Justis, the chapter leader of Students for Sensible Drug Policy at Calabasas High School.

<strong>Why did you want to get involved with SSDP?</strong>
After growing up being inaccurately taught by school programs that all drugs will either ruin your life or kill you only to later realize that this is completely inaccurate, I want to help change the education system. I have also recently heard of multiple people dying or being hospitalized from poor drug decisions. I want to help stop events like this from occurring.
<strong>What does a sensible drug policy mean to you?</strong>
To me, a sensible drug policy is an accurate system of teaching people the truths, hazards, medical benefits, and effects of different drugs. It is not promoting or disapproving the use of drugs, but allowing people to make their own decisions in a smart manner.
<strong>What do you hope to accomplish this year?</strong>
This year I hope to gather lots of students and help make SSDP an important factor in Calabasas High School. I wish to inform students on the drugs many of them are taking. Although it may not happen soon, I hope to one day save at least one person’s life.
<strong>What challenges have you faced? How do you plan to overcome them?</strong>
As I have told many people about SSDP, most of the feedback has been positive and uplifting. But, many others, mostly parents, believe it is promoting drug use and an inappropriate club for a high school. I plan to overcome them by explaining to everyone that is not the case. I will make sure to make my point while keeping it completely appropriate for a high school.
<strong>What advice would you give to people who are thinking of getting involved with SSDP?</strong>
Although I have not started much with SSDP, I already know it is going to be one of the greatest experiences of my life. Starting SSDP at your school could save many people’s lives and if you are passionate enough, your school will love it.
<strong>A fun fact?</strong>
One reason I am so passionate about this system is due to my dad. He is an advocate to end the war on drugs and works really hard to teach everyone the truth about drugs, including me.
<strong>Anything else you want to add?</strong>
Lastly, I am very excited to start this chapter. I live in an upscale neighborhood but drug use is still very common. I also understand that the criminal justice factor is a big issue in poorer areas, like the area I moved from a few years ago.
