The strong reaction from the Ferguson community, supported by concerned citizens across the country </span><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2014/08/18/how-the-rest-of-the-world-sees-ferguson/?utm_term=.a417f9b8fb7e"><span style="font-weight: 400;">and globe</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, set a precedent for community mobilization and involvement in instances of police brutality to follow. Despite the increased attention to this issue and </span><a href="http://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/to-avoid-deadly-shootings-police-deploy-new-training-tactics/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">measures taken to retrain police departments</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/investigations/number-of-fatal-shootings-by-police-is-nearly-identical-to-last-year/2017/07/01/98726cc6-5b5f-11e7-9fc6-c7ef4bc58d13_story.html?utm_term=.5544c242ecc7"><span style="font-weight: 400;">no progress has been made in recent years to decrease the number of police killings</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Many activists see the continuing problem of police brutality as an indicator of how much has gone wrong since the Civil Rights Movement, especially due to the </span><a href="http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/nationworld/ct-police-shootings-race-20160711-story.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">2.5 times higher likelihood of Black people to be shot by police than whites</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.

To understand the War on Drugs’ influence on police brutality today, we’ll briefly examine the historical ties of policing and the drug war to slavery, how police exploit the stigma surrounding drugs to vilify victims and get away with murder, and what we can do as drug policy reformers to fight police brutality. </span>

&nbsp;

<b>MASS INCARCERATION IS AN EXTENSION OF SLAVERY</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The 13th Amendment was ratified in 1865 to outlaw slavery. Article I reads, “Neither slavery nor involuntary servitude, except as a punishment for crime whereof the party shall have been duly convicted, shall exist within the United States, or any place subject to their jurisdiction.” The amendment makes an important exception &#8212; those convicted of a crime can be punished with involuntary servitude. Because slavery was not protected by or even mentioned in the Constitution until this point, the de facto effects of the 13th Amendment were that A) our traditional conception of plantation slavery was no longer allowed, but also that B) slavery was now </span><a href="http://www.nydailynews.com/news/national/king-13th-amendment-didn-abolish-slavery-article-1.2801218"><span style="font-weight: 400;">protected by the Constitution</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> so long as those forced into servitude were convicted of a crime. The southern economy suffered greatly after the amendment was ratified because of its heavy reliance on slave labor;violence and hatred toward Black people persisted, exacerbated by economic hardship. The loophole in the 13th Amendment was quickly exploited, forming the base of our modern prison industrial complex. </span><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5004736/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Blackness was criminalized</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="http://www.springfieldspringfield.co.uk/movie_script.php?movie=13th"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Black people were arrested in large numbers and forced to provide labor to rebuild the South after the Civil War</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. As the Civil Rights Movement grew in the following decades, activists were arrested for demonstrations and portrayed as</span><a href="http://www.latimes.com/opinion/op-ed/la-oe-morrison-davis-20140507-column.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> dangerous terrorists</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to defame them and discredit their work. </span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The cultivated association of Blackness and the Civil Rights Movement with criminality and danger was so strong that </span><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/937436-the-rhetoric-of-law-and-order-was-first-mobilized-in"><span style="font-weight: 400;">politicians began exploiting this association to speak to southern whites’ racism and fear to pick up their votes</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Politicians called for  “law and order” &#8212; a thinly veiled phrase they knew would </span><a href="https://polisci.osu.edu/sites/polisci.osu.edu/files/Valentino,%20Hutchings,%20White.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;">activate racial thinking</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> &#8212; and promised they were the candidate to deliver it. This was done intentionally to grab the attention of racist voters and gain public support for harsher law enforcement measures, </span><a href="http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2016/07/donald-trump-law-and-order-richard-nixon-crime-race-214066"><span style="font-weight: 400;">and that’s exactly what politicians are doing when they recycle the phrase “law and order” today.</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">  </span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Previous drug policies were also </span><a href="http://www.salon.com/2016/04/15/the_real_reasons_cocaine_heroin_and_other_drugs_partner/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">motivated by racism</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, but Nixon’s War on Drugs and establishment of the Drug Enforcement Administration quickly became the greatest front of </span><a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/eriksherman/2016/03/23/nixons-drug-war-an-excuse-to-lock-up-blacks-and-protesters-continues/#365e2c7c42c8"><span style="font-weight: 400;">racially motivated mass incarceration</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><a href="http://www.naacp.org/criminal-justice-fact-sheet/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although African Americans and whites use drugs at</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> similar rates, the rate of imprisonment of African Americans for drug offenses is nearly six times that of whites</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Prisoners today continue to provide cheap or free labor &#8212; </span><a href="https://news.vice.com/article/prisoners-all-over-the-us-are-on-strike-for-an-end-to-prison-slavery"><span style="font-weight: 400;">sewing clothes for Victoria’s Secret, scrubbing products for Wal-Mart, manning call centers for AT&amp;T</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> &#8212; and some are made to pick cotton, corn, and soybeans in the </span><a href="https://www.opendemocracy.net/beyondslavery/mark-karlin/inseparability-of-capitalism-racism-and-imprisonment-interview-with-dennis"><span style="font-weight: 400;">same fields in which their ancestors have been enslaved for centuries.</span></a>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">It is crucial to consider the modern (though not at all new) issue of police brutality in its historical context to understand why people of color, especially Black people, both are approached by police more frequently as suspects and experience police brutality at higher rates than whites. Because these historical ties are often omitted from the coverage of police brutality today, we continue to see the media paint </span><a href="https://www.mediamatters.org/blog/2016/07/07/how-news-networks-criminalize-black-victims-police-violence/211427"><span style="font-weight: 400;">victims of police killings as thugs</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, portray </span><a href="https://mic.com/articles/116524/outrage-over-baltimore-riots-completely-misses-the-point#.FUHhVlgfU"><span style="font-weight: 400;">activists and protesters as violent criminals</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and </span><a href="https://www.realclearpolitics.com/video/2015/04/28/baltimore_community_organizer_broken_windows_are_not_broken_spines_were_looking_for_justice.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">focus on the property damaged during protests instead of the victims slain by law enforcement</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The omission of this history is also why the many young people who </span><a href="http://www.teenvogue.com/story/13th-documentary-ava-duvernay-netflix"><span style="font-weight: 400;">say they wouldn’t have tolerated slavery if they lived during that time are tolerating mass incarceration and police brutality today</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span>

&nbsp;

<b>DRUG STIGMA LETS POLICE GET AWAY WITH MURDER</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Because we have so thoroughly stigmatized and ostracized people who use drugs with </span><a href="https://ssdp.org/blog/understanding-person-first-language/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">our language</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, with our lack of meaningful resources for </span><a href="https://ssdp.org/blog/just-say-know-the-history-and-role-of-drug-education/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">drug education</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="https://www.addiction.com/10687/a-new-definition-of-recovery-beyond-abstinence/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">addiction recovery</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and with our focus of criminalization, the mere mention of a police brutality victim consuming or possessing controlled substances is a powerful blow to their character and helps police escape accountability for their actions. </span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Last month, Officer Jeronimo Yanez’s defense used the odor of cannabis to justify shooting Philando Castile. Hours after he shot Castile in front of his girlfriend and 4-year-old daughter during a traffic stop, </span><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2017/06/21/officer-who-shot-philando-castile-said-smell-of-marijuana-made-him-fear-for-his-life/?utm_term=.7502269f13f9"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yanes told investigators, </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I thought I was going to die. And I thought if he’s, if he has the, the guts and the audacity to smoke marijuana in front of the five year old girl and risk her lungs and risk her life by giving her secondhand smoke and the front seat passenger doing the same thing then what, what care does he give about me.” Mr. Yanez’s fears seem to be </span><a href="http://www.drugpolicy.org/news/2017/06/drug-policy-alliance-statement-acquittal-officer-yanez-who-fatally-shot-philando-castil"><span style="font-weight: 400;">contradicted by video showing Mr. Castile to be compliant, alert, and courteous</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, but his allegations played a large role in the jury finding him not guilty. In any case, </span><a href="http://www.salon.com/2017/06/25/how-americas-idiotic-drug-prohibition-helped-kill-philando-castile-and-give-the-policeman-who-killed-him-an-excuse-to-walk-free_partner/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">secondhand smoke is not intent to harm a police officer, </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">and it’s time to stop allowing claims like Mr. Yanez’s let police off the hook for killing citizens at otherwise routine traffic stops.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">During July of 2015, Sandra Bland was pulled over for not signaling before a turn. </span><a href="http://www.latimes.com/nation/la-sandra-bland-collection-storygallery.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the dashboard recording</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Ms. Bland seems annoyed about the stop. The officer, Texas state trooper Brian Encinia, demands Ms. Bland put out her cigarette and exit the car. Ms. Bland asks if she’s under arrest. Encinia says yes but refuses to tell her what for, points his taser toward her, and threatens to “light [her] up” as he forces her to exit her car. Ms. Bland grows impatient as she continues to assert her rights, tries to call her lawyer, and is forced into handcuffs. They move out of frame, but it is clear that Encina handles Ms. Bland harshly. Ms. Bland begins crying and scolds Encina for pushing her head into the ground because she has epilepsy. Encina responds yelling, “Good!” He then orders a bystander to leave. After some more struggling and profanities, Encinia takes Ms. Bland into custody on accusations that she assaulted him. Ms. Bland told police during her intake that she had previously attempted suicide, and she was found dead in her cell three days later &#8212; </span><a href="http://abc7.com/news/two-years-later-a-look-back-at-the-sandra-bland-case/2214241/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">apparently having committed suicide</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Although it was Officer Encinia who escalated the initial encounter, claims were made that Ms. Bland consumed cannabis beforehand, causing her to behave aggressively and exacerbated her mood disorder to the point that she would commit suicide. Toxicology reports </span><a href="http://drcarlhart.com/sandra-blands-toxicology-report-debunked/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">debunk this narrative</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, but the allegations of cannabis use were effective in demonizing her. Nobody involved with the events leading up to Ms. Bland’s death was indicted. </span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">These are two of many cases where drugs were used to vilify victims of police brutality. From </span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/02/nyregion/staten-island-man-died-from-officers-chokehold-autopsy-finds.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Eric Garner</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to </span><a href="https://www.apnews.com/2a18d103de51472aa2fe9632aff41537"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sam DuBose</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and many others, police continue to use deadly force during routine encounters, </span><a href="http://www.drugpolicy.org/blog/ferguson-staten-island-justice-and-accountability-are-nowhere-sight"><span style="font-weight: 400;">defame their victims</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for possessing or selling drugs as if these actions give police the authority to kill them on the spot, and get away with their horrendous actions. </span>

&nbsp;

<b>WHAT CAN DRUG POLICY REFORMERS DO TO FIGHT POLICE BRUTALITY?</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s useless for us to know about the relationship between the drug war and police brutality if we do not bring that knowledge into our work. Here are some ideas to help you do just that:</span>
<ul>
	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Host a screening of a documentary that explores connections between drug policy and policing &#8212; “13th,” “How to Make Money Selling Drugs,” and “The House I Live In” are a few great examples</span></li>
	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Research what other student or local groups are organizing around police violence and collaborate with them</span></li>
	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Develop a prison divestment campaign &#8212; ask your school to stop supporting prison labor by purchasing and selling products made in prisons</span></li>
	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Host a demonstration or vigil in memory of victims of police brutality</span></li>
	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Encourage your local police departments to undergo de-escalation trainings</span></li>
	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Write op-eds and letters to the editor to raise awareness of police brutality and its connection to the War on Drugs</span></li>
	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hold a “Know Your Rights” event and educate your peers on protecting themselves from police</span></li>
	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reach out to school/local news and radio stations. Talk on their show. Raise awareness and bring more people to the movement.</span></li>
	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Write letters to people incarcerated for drug charges &#8212; they’d probably love to hear that you’re fighting for them</span></li>
	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Write, call, and meet with local politicians to discuss your concern about police brutality, mass incarceration, and other harms of drug prohibition</span></li>
	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Speak up when you hear friends or a classmate say that the drug war isn’t racist or Officer X’s victim deserved to get shot for breaking the law. It is. And they didn’t.  </span></li>
	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Keep this issues central in your drug policy reform efforts &#8212; it’s great if you’re focused on legalizing cannabis, but shouldn’t we make sure that growing cannabis and owning dispensaries is accessible to people who have criminal records for selling cannabis? Shouldn’t we be including efforts to expunge records and release incarcerated people for a crime we believe shouldn’t be a crime?</span></li>
	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Share this post &#8212; make sure your activist friends are aware of and care about this issue</span></li>
</ul>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">“[Police] are not a permanent fixture in society. While law enforcers have existed in one form or another for centuries, the modern police have their roots in the relatively recent rise of modern property relations 200 years ago, and the &#8220;disorderly conduct&#8221; of the urban poor. Like every structure we&#8217;ve known all our lives, it seems that the policing paradigm is inescapable and everlasting, and the only thing keeping us from the precipice of a dystopic Wild West scenario. It&#8217;s not.”</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">“Police are fully aware that they have a dangerous job in which they may get killed or injured dealing with criminals when they sign up for the job. Criminals whether they be Black or white do not represent the Black community but police do represent the government. Black citizens did not sign up for being at risk for police brutality or killings. When unarmed peaceful civilians are killed by the police, they are being killed by agents of the government that is supposed to represent them. It is this failure of government that must be addressed.”</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">“So, you understand that the police force in the U.S. upholds a system of racialized violence and white supremacy. You know that, when police get involved, Black people, people of color, queer &amp; trans people, sex workers, women, and immigrants are usually in more danger, even if they are the victims of the crime being reported. You know that police violently escalate peaceful interactions and murder Black people with impunity every single day in this country. But, your neighbor is setting off fireworks at 3am, or there’s intimate partner violence happening outside your window, or you see someone hit their child in public… What do you do? What do you do instead of calling the police? How do you keep yourself safe without seeking protection from a system that is predicated upon the surveillance and extermination of others?”</span>

Founded in 1997 at the peak of the Gazometer Raves, it established its drop-in shop homebase ten years later in Gumpendorferstraße 8, 1060 and has been a melting point for information exchange, discussion and support ever since.”</span>

&nbsp;

<b>Cambodia</b>

<a href="https://www.cambodiadaily.com/news/govt-to-continue-drug-crackdown-with-nearly-1m-budget-132497/"><b>Government to Continue Drug Crackdown with Nearly $1M Budget</b></a>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">“The campaign’s second phase will run to the end of the year, and the Interior Ministry has allocated a $1 million budget to fund anti-drug education, drug treatment, equipment and bonuses for anti-drug police, said Meas Vyrith, secretary-general of the National Authority for Combating Drugs.”</span>

<b>Canada</b>

<b>*Content Warning: article contains potentially triggering images for people in recovery*</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">On June 27, Health Canada – the federal department that oversees public health – granted permission to two drug consumption rooms (DCRs) to allow people to use drugs orally and nasally.”</span>

&nbsp;

<b>Catalonia</b>

<a href="http://www.talkingdrugs.org/catalonia-legalises-cannabis-cultivation-and-distribution"><b>Catalonia Legalises Cannabis Cultivation and Distribution</b></a>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">“Dany’s father was caught growing 52 marijuana plants on the patio of their house, which he shares with his sister, his wife and four younger brothers. It’s not the arrest itself that they want to denounce, but rather the events that immediately followed it. Officials from the government’s housing program, along with officers of the National Revolutionary Police, arrived shortly after to inform the family that they had to evacuate the premises in 72 hours. The state was confiscating their home.”</span>

&nbsp;

<b>Greece</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">“Under our proposal, commercial supply and trafficking of drugs would still be punished, but people who are caught with drugs for their own use would not face criminal penalties. Why? Because the vast majority of people who use drugs do so without causing harm to themselves or others. Prosecuting them can have a far-reaching negative impact on their lives but has limited or no effect on their drug use.”</span>

&nbsp;

<b>Philippines</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">“Despite a strict prohibition on marijuana &#8211; which is made from dried cannabis leaves and flowers &#8211; and the threat of Duterte&#8217;s crackdown on drugs, Alden manages an underground network that provides marijuana to people suffering from a wide range of medical conditions &#8211; including cancer, neurological disorders, and arthritis.”</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">“Last week&#8217;s order by Prime Minister Prayut Chan-o-cha is disappointing on several levels. The order to increase police action is a complete reversal of encouraging movement towards adoption of a more sane and sustainable policy on illicit drugs.”</span>
