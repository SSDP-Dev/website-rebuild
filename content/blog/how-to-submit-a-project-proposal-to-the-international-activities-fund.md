<span style="font-weight: 400;">Thanks to the generosity of our donors, we are proud to announce that the </span><a href="http://www.ssdp.org/iaf"><span style="font-weight: 400;">International Activities Fund</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is now fully funded and we are ready to receive project proposals. The International Activities Fund (IAF) is available for any SSDP chapter outside of the United States to utilize, provided they are in good standing with the international organization. Individual active members </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">of SSDP in good standing who are not affiliated with an established chapter are also welcome to submit proposals. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Proposals will be accepted starting </span><b>August 15, 2018</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for projects taking place during the 2018-2019 program year (ending June 30, 2019). However, no final decisions on funding will be made until </span><b>September 15, 2018</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. After this date, proposals will be evaluated on a rolling basis. To ensure your proposal is considered in a timely manner, please submit it at least two months before the start date of your project. After </span><b>December 15, 2018</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, proposals will no longer be accepted for the rest of the program year and any remaining funds in the IAF will go toward </span><a href="https://conference.ssdp.org/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">SSDP2019</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> international scholarships. </span>

<a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1jJswyjzdxT9n63WEKaDQ8PeV9z-JHr9zsbfr6nekIVs/edit?usp=sharing"><b>Please read through these instructions and guidelines to find out how to submit your project proposal.</b></a>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">To ensure objectivity and fairness, </span><b>SSDP staff cannot help write your project proposal for you</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. They are able to help develop your idea beforehand, but you must do all of the appropriate writing and budget drafting yourself. If you need assistance writing your project proposal due to technical issues or because you do not feel comfortable writing in English, we will put you in touch with someone who can help. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">For further questions, or to discuss an idea for a project proposal, please contact Jake Agliata at </span><a href="mailto:jake@ssdp.org"><span style="font-weight: 400;">jake@ssdp.org</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Thank you again to all those who helped make this fund possible!</span>
