<span style="font-weight: 400;">September 20th, 2016 marked the Second Annual 920 Psilocybin Coordinated Day of Action. SSDP is a member of the 920 Coalition which organizes annual events on September 20th focused on the therapeutic potential of psilocybin mushrooms. The 920 coalition also includes other organizations working on promoting awareness about psilocybin mushrooms and other psychedelic substances, such as </span><a href="http://www.psymposia.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Psymposia</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the </span><a href="http://www.psychedeliclub.com/index.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Psychedelic Club</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the </span><a href="http://www.meetup.com/psychedelics/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Psychedelic Society of San Francisco</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="https://www.erievision.org/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Entheogenic Research Integration and Education</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (ERIE), and </span><a href="http://cssdp.org/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Canadian Students for Sensible Drug Policy</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (CSSDP), among others. This year, the 920 Coalition hosted 35 events in 5 countries including 23 events hosted by SSDP chapters. The events hosted by SSDP chapters included documentary film screenings, panel discussions, research presentations, and informal storytelling hangouts where attendees were given opportunities to share their personal experiences with psilocybin mushrooms. Research is beginning to suggest that the therapeutic potential of psilocybin include&#8217;s anxiety reduction, overcoming depression, and treating addiction, among others.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The 920 Coalition events coordinator, Leyla Palacios, is an SSDP alumna from the University of Texas El Paso (UTEP). Leyla is responsible for maintaining the 920 Coalition website and working with the various coalition partners to plan and execute events for the Day of Action. Here is a message from Leyla:</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">It warms my heart to see 920&#8217;s momentum expand &amp; be well received by those who are aware of the coalition. It is the amazing collaborations of individuals &amp; organizations that have made 920 possible. The importance of creating a safe space where one can open up (much needed) dialogue about the efficacy &amp; experiences with psilocybin mushrooms &amp; other psychedelics became even more apparent to me after participating &amp; helping host the 920 events held in El Paso, TX &amp; Emeryville, CA; they were a resounding affirmation. I believe our annual 920 events have the potential to help stray society away from the stigma around psychedelics &amp; bring more attention to their therapeutic properties. For this reason, I am beyond grateful for everyone&#8217;s time &amp; work that has been going into the global 920 events. Love &amp; appreciation to every 920 collaborator, volunteer, &amp; supporter. THANK YOU!”</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Next year, the 3rd annual Day of Action is already looking like it will be even bigger. And, of course, SSDP chapters will be a major part of making it a success! Check this space next summer for more details about how you can get involved with planning an action in your community or on your campus. In the meantime, happy exploring!</span>
