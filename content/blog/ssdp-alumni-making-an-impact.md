On the first day of the class, the professor asked all of us why we had chosen Berkeley. Unsurprisingly, a few of us had come to Berkeley because of its history of activism, but I was surprised and elated when I heard Scarlett Swerdlow explain that her activist experience had been in drug policy, which I too had great interest in but knew little about at the time. I excitedly introduced myself to Scarlett after class and that week we founded UC Berkeley&#8217;s chapter of Students for Sensible Drug Policy.

The rest of my journey through the world of drug policy activism has unfurled much like that day, involving a bit of serendipity, a lot of enthusiasm, and the willingness to take chances and put in hours of hard work. Scarlett and I quickly grew our SSDP chapter by tabling nearly every day, holding events with expert speakers, and even by teaching classes to our peers. I also stepped up to leadership roles within the national organization, serving two years on the Board of Directors and helping launch the alumni network.

Immediately after graduating, I was hired to direct a Democratic National Committee fundraising office that raised more than one million dollars for the 2004 presidential campaign. Serendipity then hit me again, when I found out that Americans for Safe Access (ASA), the largest national member-based organization promoting safe and legal access to cannabis for therapeutic use and research, was hiring a field coordinator. I had volunteered extensively for ASA during my college years, including bringing 200 Berkeley students to a rally of theirs in Sacramento so I knew it would be a perfect fit.

After two years of working with ASA&#8217;s chapter and activist leaders, I moved on to become ASA&#8217;s chief of staff. I manage ASA&#8217;s staff and projects and I have the incredible opportunity to hire new staff. For nearly every position we advertise, an SSDP leader applies and I always look closely at their applications because I know first-hand what it takes to run an SSDP chapter.

When I&#8217;m not busy at work or with activism, I write at my blog, living in the O, which focuses on Oakland community, politics, and planning.
