I didn&#8217;t realize it when I left for the first <a href="http://www.intercambios.org.ar/english/marco.htm">Latin American Conference on Drug Policy</a> in Argentina a few weeks ago (scroll down a couple of posts for more), but the country was on its way to setting a historical precedent in creation of sensible drug policy. While it may not be <a href="http://www.salon.com/opinion/greenwald/2009/03/14/portugal/">Portugal</a> or <a href="http://stopthedrugwar.org/chronicle/598/mexico_decriminalization_law_enacted">Mexico</a>, the new law is undoubtedly the first step in a new approach for the South American nation.

The Supreme Court announced a UNANIMOUS <a href="http://www.buenosairesherald.com/BreakingNews/View/10082">ruling</a> today that allows for personal use and possession of marijuana by adults in private situations without affecting third parties. It has deemed the current system invasive and corrupt, and a literal violation of constitutional privacy rights.

Of course, most of us realize that any government intervention regarding what we put into our own bodies is a violation of personal privacy. But isn&#8217;t it nice to see formidable heads of government agreeing?

The court goes on to suggest that (gasp!) treatment for drug addiction is a more viable alternative to incarceration and that resources are better used fighting violent drug traffickers than low-level offenders.

The Chief Cabinet Minister Aníbal Fernández suggested the ruling signifies an &#8220;end of the repressive policies of the government against users.&#8221;

A good day, indeed.
