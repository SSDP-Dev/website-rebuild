Last week, I had the opportunity to join Alyson Martin and Nushin Rashidian at a <a title="Cato Book Forum: A New Leaf" href="http://www.cato.org/events/new-leaf-end-cannabis-prohibition" target="_blank">Cato Book Forum</a> to discuss their new book, <em><a title="SSDP Reources - Books" href="http://ssdp.org/resources/books#anewleaf" target="_blank">A New Leaf: The End of Cannabis Prohibition</a>.</em> A particularly engaging read, <em>A New Leaf</em> takes an in-depth look at the legal history of cannabis in the US  &#8212; and reform efforts &#8212; through artful storytelling and insightful analysis.

At last Friday&#8217;s panel discussion, moderated by Cato&#8217;s Caleb Brown, Martin and Rashidian discussed their experience researching and writing the book, the transition from illicit to regulated markets, and their projections about what the future may hold. I was able to talk about my experiences working on Colorado&#8217;s Amendment 64 to regulate marijuana like alcohol, the efforts of SSDP students in support of Amendment 64, and what the student movement will look like when we reach a post-prohibition world.

Check out the video on Cato&#8217;s site:
