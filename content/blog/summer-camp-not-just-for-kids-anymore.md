<p dir="ltr">The AMPLIFY Project is excited &amp; honored to be taking part in the <a href="http://summercampfestival.com/community/make-a-difference/">“Make a Difference”</a> area yet again this year at <a href="http://summercampfestival.com/">Summer Camp Music Festival</a> being held at <a href="http://www.threesisterspark.com/">Three Sisters Park</a> in Chillicothe, IL from May 23rd-26th. One of the premier music festivals in the Midwest and country at large, Summer Camp will be starting the festival season off right with a four day long extravaganza sure to excite the senses, open the mind, free the spirit &amp; inspire positive change!</p>

<p dir="ltr">The musical lineup (countless of which are partnered artists) alone makes it a not miss with 3 days of both moe. &amp; Umphrey’s McGee plus Trey Anastasio Band, STS9, The Avett Brothers, Thievery Corporation, Yonder Mountain String Band &amp; Big Boi just to name a few. (<a href="http://summercampfestival.com/lineup/)">click here</a> to see the full lineup). Yet in addition to musical delights Summer Camp also offers attendees the opportunity to harness their collective energies towards positive change in their “Make a Difference” area.</p>

<em>“The &#8216;Make A Difference&#8217; area at Summer Camp is a space for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collective_consciousness">collective consciousness</a>. We invite you to come increase your social and environmental awareness by exploring everything the “Make A Difference Area” has to offer. Learn about the work of different <a href="http://summercampfestival.com/about/non-profit-information/">nonprofit organizations</a>. Hear inspiring stories of how artists and activists are taking steps towards positive change and getting involved in our workshops. Participate in activities, such as yoga and the Green Raffle. And, relax in the Soulshine Tent to acoustic sets performed by some of your favorite bands. With activities around the clock, the Make A Difference Area will provide you with an eye opening, and maybe even transforming, experience.”</em>

<p dir="ltr">We could not have said it any better than that! We will be joining other great &amp; varied organizations this year such as <a href="http://www.consciousalliance.org/">Conscious Alliance</a>, <a href="http://www.buffalofieldcampaign.org/">Buffalo Field Campaign</a>, <a href="http://www.headcount.org/">HeadCount</a>, <a href="http://www.petersongarden.org/">Peterson Garden Project</a>, <a href="http://happyhourhero.org/">Happy Hour Heroes</a>, <a href="http://www.rocktheearth.org/joomla/">Rock the Earth</a> &amp; <a href="http://www.stlsloup.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/sloupfinal.pdf">Regen STL</a>.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Our “AMPLIFY Chill Lounge”, debuted at Rootwire ‘12, will also be making an appearance to once again provide festival goer’s a safe, cool &amp; calm environment to relax if needed. Our volunteers will be manning it late into the nights keeping it stocked with plenty of free water, blankets and good vibes all in an effort to prevent unnecessary police intervention and/or off-site medical transport during psychedelic emergencies and other substance related situations easily preventable or treatable on-site by trained personnel.</p>
