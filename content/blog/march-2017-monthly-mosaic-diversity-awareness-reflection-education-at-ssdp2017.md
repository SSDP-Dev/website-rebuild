<span style="font-weight: 400;">A hearty welcome to </span><a href="https://ssdp.org/events/ssdp2017/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">SSDP2017</span></a> <span style="font-weight: 400;">from SSDP’s Diversity, Awareness, Reflection, &amp; Education (SSDP-DARE) committee!</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Because the consequences of drug prohibition are far-reaching in their impact on different communities across the globe, exposing oneself to new perspectives is crucial to understanding  the totality of the drug war. We hope that you’ll seize the opportunity presented by </span><a href="https://ssdp.org/events/ssdp2017/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">SSDP2017</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to make lasting connections with students, alumni, and allies from around the world, and help each other become better, more effective, and more engaged activists. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">This special conference-focused issue of the </span><a href="/?tag=monthly-mosaic"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Monthly Mosaic</span></i></a> <span style="font-weight: 400;">will discuss intersectionality, inclusion, and diversity at </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><a href="https://ssdp.org/events/ssdp2017/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">SSDP2017</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span>

<hr />

<h3><b>WHAT DOES IT MEAN TO BE DIVERSE?</b></h3>
&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">One of SSDP’s key values is diversity and inclusion, and </span><a href="https://ssdp.org/diversity/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">the DARE committee strives to create a welcoming, open, and safe space</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for all stakeholders working to end the war on drugs. We endeavor to ensure that the range of perspectives of all communities and individuals negatively impacted by the War on Drugs are represented and  integrated into SSDP and the drug policy reform movement at large.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">SSDP-DARE </span><a href="https://ssdp.org/diversity/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">defines diversity</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> as including but not limited to:</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Age; Background, Class or Socioeconomic Identification; Culture and Traditions; Current Student or Nonstudent Status; Disability or Differently-Abled Status; Diversity of Opinion; Employment Status; Ethnicity; Gender Identification; Ideology; Language; Mental Health; Moral Framework; Nationality; Physical Health; Political Affiliation; Pregnancy &amp; Parenting Status (pregnant people, custodial and noncustodial parents, foster and adoptive parents, legal guardians, etc); Primary Movement of Identification (formerly incarcerated, recovery, student, etc.); Race; Relationship Orientation and Status; Relationship With Drugs/How One Self-Identifies in Relation to Drugs (user, non drug user, addict, recreational user, medical user, abstainer, in recovery, etc.); Religion; Sexual Identification; Stake in Reform; Subculture; and any other self-identifiers.</span>

<hr />

<h3><b>CONFERENCES AS A PRIVILEGED FORM OF ORGANIZING.</b></h3>
&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Being able to attend conferences is a privilege that many activists do not have. The cost of conference registration fees, travel expenses, lodging, and food can make attending a conference an expensive endeavor.  SSDP works very hard to ensure that as many students in the network as possible can attend the annual conference by providing scholarships through the CAT point system to cover registration and lodging, and </span><a href="https://ssdp.org/diversity/donate/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">SSDP-DARE also has our own scholarship fund</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> f</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">or people who bring diverse perspectives to the table. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The bureaucratic process involved with international travel also makes it difficult to attend conferences. Folks traveling from outside a country’s borders may need to apply for visas (</span><a href="https://visaguide.world/us-visa/fees/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">most U.S. visas cost around $160 dollars</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">). Nonetheless, 31 international students will be attending </span><a href="https://ssdp.org/events/ssdp2017/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">SSDP2017</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Out of the 31 international students, 19 needed to apply for visas to come. 12 additional students applied for visas and were rejected.</span>

<h3><b>GENDER NEUTRAL BATHROOMS &amp; PRONOUNS ON BADGES.</b></h3>
&nbsp;

Two major changes you might notice at this year’s conference — and all future SSDP conferences — are gender neutral bathrooms and conference badges with personal gender pronouns.
<h4><b>What are personal gender pronouns?</b></h4>
<a href="https://uwm.edu/lgbtrc/support/gender-pronouns/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Personal gender pronouns (or PGP)</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> are the pronouns that individuals use for themselves (e.g. she/her, he/him, they/them, etc). </span><a href="http://ssdp.org/news/blog/november-monthly-mosaic/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">SSDP Staff and Board members have been including their pronouns in their email signatures for quite a while now</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> This year’s conference registration form also included a section where registrants could enter their personal gender pronouns, which will be included on their conference badges, helping all of us better respect the gender identities of our members. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">SSDP strives to make a welcoming space for all of our members, so please respect people’s personal gender pronouns. </span><a href="http://lbgtrc.msu.edu/educational-resources/pronouns/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Being misgendered can make someone feel invalidated and dysphoric</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.  If you make a mistake, you can quickly say “sorry, I meant [whichever pronoun the person uses]” and move on. </span>
<h4><b>Why gender neutral bathrooms?</b></h4>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Gender neutral bathrooms are bathrooms that anyone of any gender can use. They  acknowledge the fact that </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender_binary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">there are more than two genders</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and are necessary because </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender_binary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">not everyone identifies in the binary of male and female</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">In order to provide a safer space for transgender individuals, it is crucial that gender neutral bathrooms are easily accessible.  </span><a href="https://williamsinstitute.law.ucla.edu/press/study-transgender-people-experience-discrimination-trying-to-use-bathrooms/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Transgender and gender nonconforming people can often find themselves in danger in gendered spaces</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and transgender people are </span><a href="http://transwellness.org/resources/educational-materials/gender-neutral-bathrooms/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">more likely to face harassment, intimidation, or threats in gender segregated bathrooms</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Members of the transgender, genderqueer, and gender non-conforming community face </span><a href="http://transwellness.org/resources/educational-materials/gender-neutral-bathrooms/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">specific concerns and threats to safety</span></a> <span style="font-weight: 400;">depending on</span> <a href="http://transwellness.org/resources/educational-materials/gender-neutral-bathrooms/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">how they are read in certain situations</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. For example, </span><a href="http://transwellness.org/resources/educational-materials/gender-neutral-bathrooms/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">if a woman in a women’s-only restroom is assumed to be a man, she may have the police called on her or worse</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Often,</span> <a href="http://transwellness.org/resources/educational-materials/gender-neutral-bathrooms/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">transgender, genderqueer, and gender non-conforming people must  go far out of their way to gain access to bathrooms</span></a> <span style="font-weight: 400;">that are more private or comfortable.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Additionally, gender neutral bathrooms are more convenient for families and people with disabilities. Parents can accompany their children to the bathroom no matter what gender they are.  People with disabilities who need assistance when using the bathroom can be attended by a different-sex friend, family member, or caretaker.  </span>

<h3><b>HOW TO MAKE SSDP2017 A SAFER SPACE FOR INTERNATIONAL STUDENTS</b></h3>
<b>
</b><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">SSDP is a global community, and our conferences are a global space. </span></i><a href="https://ssdp.org/events/ssdp2017/"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">SSDP2017</span></i></a><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> will have students from all over the world present, and it’s important we make sure guests to our country feel both welcome and safe. Here are some tips to help create this environment&#8230;</span></i>
<ul>
 	<li><b>Be respectful of cultural differences<span style="font-weight: 400;">. Many of the international SSDPers attending </span><a href="https://ssdp.org/events/ssdp2017/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">SSDP2017</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> have never been to the United States before and could be experiencing some culture shock. Make them feel welcome by introducing yourself, and asking where they are from and what drug policy is like in their country. </span></b></li>
 	<li><strong>Create space for global perspectives</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>.</strong> The vast majority of attendees &amp; speakers at the conference will be from the United States, so it’s important to include space for international students to share perspectives from their countries. If you’re sitting next to an international student in a panel, ask them what they think of the topic and empower them to ask questions or share a perspective. During networking time, ask international students what challenges they face as drug policy activists in their home country. SSDP conferences are a great opportunity to learn from each other.</span></li>
 	<li><b>Participate in cultural exchanges</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. As important as it is to make space for global perspectives, international students also want to learn about where you are from as well. Tell them about where you grew up, how you got involved with SSDP, and suggest things to see and do while they are in the US. Many of the international students attending </span><a href="https://ssdp.org/events/ssdp2017/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">SSDP2017</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> will be staying in the country for a few weeks to attend other conferences and would love to hear your suggestions.</span></li>
 	<li><b>Assume best intent. <span style="font-weight: 400;">There are many countries where discussing drugs is still a very taboo topic, and as such, you might hear some international students refer to using drugs as “sinful” or “morally wrong.” When you hear stigmatizing language like this, try calling in instead of calling out, and invite them to share their perspective with you. At the end of the day, we’re all here to end the War on Drugs, and you’ll ultimately find you have more in common with international students than you have differences.</span></b></li>
 	<li><strong>Break the language barrier</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>.</strong> While some international students may come from English-speaking countries, English is a second language for many others. When talking with a student whose primary language is not English, be patient, speak slowly, and don’t shy away from striking up a conversation. Dust off your high school foreign language skills and try your best! If you’re bilingual, consider offering to translate for an international student with questions.</span></li>
 	<li><b>Stay connected after the conference</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Make sure you exchange contact info, add each other on Facebook, and make plans to keep talking to the international students you befriend at </span><a href="https://ssdp.org/events/ssdp2017/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">SSDP2017</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Who knows? You may find yourself in their country one day, in need of a guide or place to crash!</span></li>
