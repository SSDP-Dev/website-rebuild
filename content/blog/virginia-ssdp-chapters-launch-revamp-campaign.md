On April 20</span><span id="E20">th</span><span id="E21">, </span><span id="E22">a couple months of planning came to fruition for SSDP chapters across Virginia as the </span><span id="E24">ReVAMP</span><span id="E26"> campaign was finally kicked into gear. </span><span id="E28">ReVAMP</span><span id="E30"> stands for Repealing Virginia Marijuana Prohibition and is primarily an effort to make the voices of Virginian youth </span><span id="E31">heard on the issue of c</span><span id="E32">annabis prohibition. Unlike the states that have legalized marijuana so far, Virginia does not have ballot initiatives, meaning any policy change will have to happen through the legislature</span><span id="E34">. </span><span id="E35">Our state</span><span id="E36"> is </span><span id="E37">also </span><span id="E38">considered by many in drug policy circles to be one of the last states to legalize cannabis</span><span id="E39">,</span><span id="E40"> which makes it all that much more important to make sure opposition to such policies is known. </span><span id="E41">So in order to effect change we have to take the fight directly to our representatives. </span></p>


<div id="attachment_18575" style="width: 399px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><a href="/assets/ssdptabling420.jpg"><img class="wp-image-18575" src="http://ssdp.org/assets/ssdptabling420-300x200.jpg" alt="ssdptabling420" width="389" height="259" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">The Virginia Tech SSDP chapter, pictured here tabling on campus, started the ReVAMP campaign.</p></div>
<p id="E42"><span id="E43">In order to do this, we have set up an action center on the SSDP website that will automatically send a message to the representative of a registered Virginia voter. Through this action center (</span><a href="http://ssdp.org/action/revamp"><span id="E44">http://ssdp.org/action/revamp</span></a><span id="E45">) we hope to get students from across the state to flood their representatives with </span><span id="E46">emails demanding an end to prohibition. This platform makes it easy to share a consistent message with all Virginia residents, from Richmond to the Blue Ridge Mountains. We hope that having a large volume of these letters sent to representatives will be what convinces them to look at supporting future legislation. </span></p>
<p id="E47"><span id="E48">The idea for this campaign came back in </span><span id="E49">February from the Virginia Tech chapter leader, Kyle Gentle. We knew that we wanted a big campaign to focus on so that we could propose it to other chapters and affect real change. The next step was to figure out how we were going to do it. We started with the idea for a petition to legalize cannabis in Virginia but we knew that has been tried before, so we decided to switch our attention to cont</span><span id="E50">acting representatives directly </span><span id="E51">in a way that wasn’</span><span id="E52">t just</span><span id="E53"> names on a piece of paper. Activists for decades have known the power of having concerned citizens contact thei</span><span id="E54">r representatives directly as</span><span id="E55"> they</span><span id="E56"> are always concerned with</span><span id="E57"> constituent’s opinions. Our next step was to formulate a </span><span id="E58">message which would resonate with a fairly conservative audience. Facts and figures on costs, law enforcement effectiveness and opinion polls are key points to winning over our legislators, especially those on the right side of the aisle. Finally, it was time to solidify the release details. We knew almost from the beginning that we wanted to use 4/20 as the symbolic release date for the campaign. All that was left to do was to reserve a table on campus, </span><span id="E59">set up our display, and get started letting our voices be heard. </span></p>
<p id="E60"><span id="E61">On release day, we got dozens of people interested in sending their message to members of the General Assembly just at Virginia Tech alone. The chapter at the University of Virginia almost </span><span id="E62">doubled that number at the</span><span id="E66">ir simultaneous release event. But the release is only the beginning </span>as this campaign will be able to expand its reach to more chapters. We will continue to be <span id="E67">dedicated to the campaign into the coming in order to keep a constant stream of letters flowing to representatives. </span><span id="E69">ReVAMP</span><span id="E71"> will be our main focus for the next year or so and we are really confident it will pick up considerable steam as it progresses. The fight may not be easy in a state where marijuana arrests have risen by almost 76% between 2003 and 2013, but it is a necessary step in making this state, in which we live and love, a better place.</span></p>
