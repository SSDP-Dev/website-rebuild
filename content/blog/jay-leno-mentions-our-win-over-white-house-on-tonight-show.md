Last night, Jay Leno made a joke about <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/in-the-loop/post/white-house-softball-team-smoked-by-pot-lobbys-bats/2012/06/12/gJQAJydhXV_blog.html" target="_blank">our softball team&#8217;s 25-3 win over The White House&#8217;s team</a> in our game last week. <em>Begin the clip at 1:18</em>

This is my sixth season playing for <a title="The One Hitters" href="http://onehitterssoftball.wordpress.com/" target="_blank">The One Hitters</a>, and my first season as Co-Captain. I feel honored to be a part of this unique team, especially when our players include staff members from not only <a href="http://ssdp.org/" target="_blank">Students for Sensible Drug Policy</a>, but also the <a href="http://mpp.org" target="_blank">Marijuana Policy Project</a>, <a href="http://safeaccess.org" target="_blank">Americans for Safe Access</a>, <a href="http://drcnet.org" target="_blank">Drug Reform Coordination Network</a> (StopTheDrugWar.org), <a href="http://drugpolicy.org" target="_blank">Drug Policy Alliance</a>, and <a href="http://studentsforliberty.org" target="_blank">Students for Liberty</a>!



It felt amazing to be able to take out some of our policy frustrations with the White House on the field in a friendly game of softball.
