Meet Karen Walker, SSDP&#8217;s new Peer Education intern!

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Karen Walker first became involved with SSDP when Board Member Stephanie Izquieta founded a chapter at Binghamton University. After attending the Northeast Regional Conference in the spring of 2015, she was introduced to the depth and weight of the devastating drug war and decided to take on the role of Chapter Leader the following year. Throughout the year, Karen focused on building and growing the chapter in its earliest stages and consistently emphasized harm reduction practices. She facilitated the creation of the “Party Guidebook to Safe &amp; Sensible Drug Use” to share practical information on safe drug use and important resources with students on campus. As the Peer Education intern, she will continue this work to initiate the launch of the Peer Education Program. Karen has also attended the 2015 International Drug Policy Reform conference and SSDP 2016 and has been constantly learning and sharing knowledge and stories in her efforts to change perspectives and end the drug war.</span>
