The <a href="http://www.boston.com/news/local/new_hampshire/articles/2009/10/29/medical_marijuana_bill_fails_in_new_hampshire/">NH Senate wouldn&#8217;t budge</a>on overriding Gov. Patrick Lynch&#8217;s veto of the law which had passed both the House and Senate earlier this year. The 14-10 vote was in favor of the bill but didn&#8217;t give the 2/3 majority needed for the override.

When Gov. Lynch said that he had 11 concerns with the bill that if left unaddressed, would leave him to veto the bill, NH Compassion compromised and addressed all of the points. Still, Lynch carried out this veto threat despite medical marijuana legalization having the <a href="http://nhcommonsense.org/poll">support of 71% of NH residents</a>.

SSDP chapters at Franklin Pierce University, Keene State College, UNH, Southern NH University, and Nashua High School South did all they could to draw attention to the need for legislation to help protect sick and dying NH residents who found marijuana helped to improve their quality of life.

For the past year, NH Compassion told the stories of numerous ill people in NH and the positive impact medical marijuana has had on their lives. Sadly, one of those NH residents, <a href="http://nhcompassion.org/scott_turner_1962_2009">Scott Turner</a>, passed away before the override vote had happened. <a href="http://nhcompassion.org/patients">Please read more</a> about the patients that Gov. Lynch and NH Attorney General Kelly Ayotte believe NH should waste tax dollars and law enforcement resources to put behind bars.

We&#8217;ll be back to ensure that these people will not face arrest for trying to improve their lives.

A huge thank you from SSDP goes out to Matt Simon and all NH medical marijuana patients.
