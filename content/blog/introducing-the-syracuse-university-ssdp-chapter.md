I&#8217;m thrilled to announce that we have a new SSDP chapter in New York at Syracuse University! I spoke with the chapter leader, Analise Sesay, about what they have accomplished so far and discussed their goals for the future.

<strong>How did you hear about SSDP?</strong><strong> </strong>I was referred to SSDP by Kamani Jefferson.

<strong>Why did you want to get involved/what made you decide to start a chapter?</strong> I am passionate about disrupting the stigmas surrounding cannabis and helping people of color, who have been most negatively impacted by cannabis criminalization, enter the emerging industry.

<strong>What has the reception been like on campus? From students, teachers, administration, etc.</strong> People are really excited about SSDP coming to campus. We have already been approached by a well-funded student organizati<a href="/assets/Screen-Shot-2017-01-27-at-12.39.32-PM.png"><img class="size-medium wp-image-20959 alignleft" src="http://ssdp.org/assets/Screen-Shot-2017-01-27-at-12.39.32-PM-223x300.png" alt="" width="223" height="300" /></a>on to collaborate on a large demonstration and speaking engagement in the spring on the topic of mass incarceration.

<strong>What are some of the things you have planned or want to plan for next semester?</strong> We are bringing speakers from the New York Hemp Industry Association and Cannabis Cultural Association to speak to our members. We also plan on having representation at the Leadership Conference in Portland!

<strong>What is the most challenging part of your experience starting/running the chapter so far?</strong><strong> </strong>I would say getting everything in order to be a recognized student organization.

<strong>What is the most rewarding part?</strong> Being part of such a relevant movement that actually seems to be going in the direction we want! I feel very optimistic towards necessary drug policy reform happening.

<strong>What are you most excited about for your chapter/school/state/region/ss<wbr />dp/drug policy right now? </strong>I hope to facilitate SU students being a major part of moving New York towards marijuana legalization.

<strong>What is your vision for Syracuse? Where do you see your chapter in a year? in 4 or 5 years? </strong>I am graduating in May but I am working closely with a sophomore, Emily Connors, who will take on the chapter after I leave. I would love to SSDP to have a strong presence on campus and be a recognized student organization that is well known to the Syracuse community.
