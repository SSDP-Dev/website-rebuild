Maryland’s state legislature voted over the weekend to decriminalize possession of 10 grams or less of marijuana. When Governor O’Malley signs the bill, which he said he <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/local/md-politics/maryland-gov-omalley-will-sign-marijuana-decriminalization-bill-senior-aide-says/2014/04/07/d50ec44c-be8f-11e3-bcec-b71ee10e9bc3_story.html" target="_blank">intends</a> to do, Maryland will join the District of Columbia and <a href="http://www.people-press.org/2013/04/04/marijuana-timeline/" target="_blank">24 other states</a> who have legalized or decriminalized marijuana.

<p dir="ltr">This is a splendid victory for marijuana law reformers! 50% of all states in the union have now lowered penalties for marijuana or in some cases removed them entirely!</p>

<p dir="ltr">Maryland didn&#8217;t go as far as Colorado or Washington in fully legalizing, taxing and regulating marijuana but decriminalization is an important first step. Now when citizens of Maryland choose to use a substance that is known to be less dangerous than alcohol they will no longer be criminalized for their choice. Under the new law marijuana infractions will be treated similarly to a traffic ticket, a minor fine and no jail time.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Half of the country is on the right track to reform, all eyes are now on the remaining 25 states. <strong>If you live in a state that hasn&#8217;t decriminalized yet, please take this time to <a href="http://ssdp.org/action/ending-federal-marijuana-prohibition-act-of-2013/" target="_blank">send a letter to your congressman</a> to support ending the federal prohibition of marijuana!</strong></p>
