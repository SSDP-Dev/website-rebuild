<h2>Back-to-School: Building an Inclusive Chapter</h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400">Summer is coming to an end, and, if it hasn’t started already, the beginning of the school year is quickly approaching. </span><a href="http://ssdp.org/resources/student-organizing-manual/recruiting-members/"><span style="font-weight: 400">Recruiting members</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> is one of the first and most important actions that chapters can take to build their network and engage other student activists. Planning out how you will conduct outreach and organize actions  will help your chapter attract new SSDP rock stars and continue to grow in size and influence.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">Before you start recruitment, however, it is important to evaluate your chapter and identify opportunities for improvement. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">This issue of the </span><a href="http://ssdp.org/news/blog/tag/monthly-mosaic/"><i><span style="font-weight: 400">Monthly Mosaic</span></i></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> will answer the  “</span><a href="http://everydayfeminism.com/2016/06/questions-for-anti-racist-orgs/"><span style="font-weight: 400">5 Questions an Anti-Racist Organization Should Be Able to Answer</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">” for SSDP as an organization. We hope it will help to illustrate what it means — in practice — to be committed to inclusion. </span>

<h2><b>HOW HAVE YOU SET UP OR RESTRUCTURED PROCESSES IN THE SERVICE OF INCLUSION?</b></h2>
<a href="http://everydayfeminism.com/2016/06/questions-for-anti-racist-orgs/"><i><span style="font-weight: 400">“For everyone to have a fair shot at excellence, we need to question our present standards. In what ways does a white-dominant culture limit how we define success, work, competence, and community?”</span></i></a>

<b><i>Accessibility</i></b><span style="font-weight: 400">: This year, the </span><a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/198658483498623/?ref=br_tf"><span style="font-weight: 400">DARE committee</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> has taken several steps to increase accessibility to higher-level discussions in SSDP.

<b><i>Integration</i></b><span style="font-weight: 400">: At the 2016 Strategy Summit at UC Berkeley, SSDP students, staff, and board members discussed various ways in which each stakeholder could integrate inclusion work into their various roles within SSDP. Within SSDP staff, each person has taken on the role of DARE ambassador, meaning they are  responsible for identifying barriers to and opportunities for more intentional inclusion, as well as providing feedback to the </span><a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/198658483498623/?ref=br_tf"><span style="font-weight: 400">DARE committee</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">.</span>

<b><i>Inclusion</i></b><span style="font-weight: 400">: To incentivize SSDP students to participate in actions and dialogue that feed SSDP’s commitment to diversity, SSDP has added DARE action items to the </span><a href="http://cat.ssdp.org"><span style="font-weight: 400">Chapter Activity Tracker</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">.

<h2><b>WHAT HAVE BEEN THE EXPERIENCES OF PEOPLE OF COLOR IN YOUR ORGANIZATION?</b></h2>
<a href="http://everydayfeminism.com/2016/06/questions-for-anti-racist-orgs/"><i><span style="font-weight: 400">“What if you’re not only a person of color, but also queer and radically politicized and the sort of fiery, unpliable spirit that may not last six years in a system of compromise?&#8230;If candidates want to do informational interviews, recruiters need to provide a variety of contacts – members who are thriving within the organization and members who are struggling. Not just the success stories. The people in pain, too.”</span></i></a>

<span style="font-weight: 400">Read some quotes from students of color in our organization:</span>
<blockquote><i><span style="font-weight: 400">“Being a member of SSDP as well as a person of color is a both an opportunity and a challenge. There’s an opportunity to offer my voice and experiences to the conversation at hand. The challenge sometimes is getting people to listen or even believe that the drug war is having such a detrimental effect especially when it relates to communities of color. There&#8217;s a big difference to the perspective that I can bring versus someone who has only read about heroin addiction statistics in low income urban area or what they&#8217;ve seen in &#8220;The Wire&#8221;. It&#8217;s a struggle sometimes trying to educate those about the harmful effects of drugs while living in an environment that basically offers nothing but drug abuse and black market activities. I remember the first tabling I had with my chapter president. We were attempting to converse with two young ladies about the harmful and wasteful effects of the Drug War. One of the girls promptly said to me without hesitation, &#8220;Oh the drug war&#8217;s over. Not that big of a deal anymore.&#8221; Leland saw the look of bewilderment that covered my face after this young lady&#8217;s comment. I quickly replied to her that, &#8220;Not for people like me it isn&#8217;t.&#8221; Leland followed with, &#8220;Well if he&#8217;s four times likely to be stopped more than I am, then there&#8217;s obviously something wrong about your statement.&#8221; Moments like that make me realize why my voice matters and that I shouldn&#8217;t shirk away from educating those about the continuous injustices of the War on Drugs. My black life matters and my voice shall be heard.”</span></i></blockquote>
<i><span style="font-weight: 400">Jake Plowden, City College of New York Baruch</span></i>

&nbsp;
<blockquote><i><span style="font-weight: 400">“At first I felt disappointed by the lack of diversity and what felt like hegemonic discussions that excluded people and issues that I cared about. However, when I got to meet members from El Salvador, México, and Costa Rica I was really inspired by all the work they do in their communities and was grateful to hear their stories and perspectives. I think if more people understood and appreciated that the drug war isn&#8217;t just about harm reduction or legalization, but also about human rights, repression, and transnational corporate interests we can broaden and deepen our discussions and activism.”</span></i></blockquote>
<i><span style="font-weight: 400">Anonymous, UC Berkeley</span></i>

&nbsp;
<blockquote><i><span style="font-weight: 400">“Although the war on drugs disproportionately affects POC with brown and black skin, I think it&#8217;s important to hear Asian voices especially when Asians have a long history rooted in drugs and policy. It feels as though Asians are disregarded/not discussed in the war on drugs and that our role is ignored. Seemingly, this leads to a lack of Asian representation in an organization like this. It&#8217;s disheartening when approximately 40% of my school population identifies as Asian, but few of these Asians appear at SSDP meetings and few Asians have headed SSDP chapters.”</span></i></blockquote>

<span style="font-weight: 400">SSDP is a grassroots organization that believes in empowering those working on the ground to overthrow their drug war oppressors.

<span style="font-weight: 400">From the </span><a href="http://ssdp.org/diversity/"><span style="font-weight: 400">DARE mission statement</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">:</span>
<blockquote><em><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Since its founding in March 2011, DARE has taken on the challenges of strengthening diversity in all its forms within SSDP. The committee endeavors to ensure that the range of perspectives &amp; personal experiences of all communities and individuals negatively impacted in the War on Drugs are represented &amp; integrated into SSDP &amp; the drug policy reform movement at large. DARE does this by creating a welcoming, open, &amp; safe space for all stakeholders.&#8221;</span></em></blockquote>
