<em>Written by Leo Leon</em>

An internship is a way to gain experience and connections to an industry college students plan on being a part of. For most students, they’re seen as a glimpse at what the “adult” life is really like. I was fortunate enough to land my first internship with <a href="http://4frontventures.com/" target="_blank">4Front Ventures</a> through the <a href="http://ssdp.org/career-services-program/" target="_blank">SSDP internship program</a> this past spring and it has been one of the best experiences of my college career so far.

4Front Ventures is at the *ahem* forefront of the burgeoning legal marijuana industry. They primarily provide consulting services to people who are trying to start their own dispensaries, as well as other services. They are very much a group that is dedicated to not only legitimizing the industry (and defeating prohibition), but also expanding it to new horizons by bringing in experts from various industries. As a business student, I was very excited to get the chance to work and be around these extraordinary people.

While interning with 4Front, I got to sit in calls with the awesome staff that is 4Front and see how they communicate, prioritize and execute their work and with clients that were trying to build their own dispensaries. Along with the financial and social media work that I did, I was allowed to see what really goes on behind the scenes in the industry. However, not only was my internship experience phenomenal, the resources and support that were provided by the SSDP Career Services program staff were just as amazing.

The SSDP Career Services program staff, Dylan and Zach, held weekly check-ins and classes that were aimed at developing our professional self. They called to see how we were doing, what we had been up to, and if we had any questions about anything related to the program and the work we were doing. This interaction definitely allowed me to feel comfortable and discuss topics that were very helpful to my understanding of the work I was doing. In addition, the staff held biweekly classes with experts from different sectors of the marijuana industry. We got to hear talks from public relations specialists, public speaking specialists, financial specialists, and legislative specialists who gave valuable insight. I really recommend that students take the opportunity to be a part of this amazing program that SSDP has put forth.
