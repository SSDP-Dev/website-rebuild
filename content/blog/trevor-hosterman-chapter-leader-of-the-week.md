<strong>SSDP: When did you 1st get involved with SSDP?</strong>
Trevor: I first got involved with SSDP in the fall of 2009 when my cofounder, Josh Merer, and I decided we wanted to make a change on our campus and in our community when it came to drug policy and harm reduction.

<strong>SSDP: What has been your favorite SSDP experience?</strong>
Trevor: My whole experience with SSDP has been remarkable. From conferences to camping trips, everything has been amazing. One of my favorite experience as a chapter was when we had the opportunity to host the former Governor of New Mexico, Gary Johnson.

<strong>SSDP: What issues are most important for your chapter?</strong>
Trevor: Right now one of the biggest issues we&#8217;re looking into as a chapter is how to get our school to adopt a medical amnesty policy. They told us they won&#8217;t do anything until the state does something first. So as a chapter we want to make sure our state representatives reintroduce SB 488 this year. SB 488 called for state wide medical amnesty in cases of alcohol poisoning.

<strong>SSDP: Do you have any events planned for the this semester? </strong>
Trevor: We sure do! We&#8217;re kicking off the semester with a show at a local venue with Roots of Creation headlining on February 5. In the works we have a lobby day at the capital, a camping trip and we have a couple more things in the works.

<strong>SSDP:</strong> What do you like best about being part of SSDP?
Trevor: The wonderful, passionate friends I have met along the way.

<strong>SSDP: Any fun facts about you?
</strong>Trevor: I love concerts. I think I went to about sixty or so in 2010. You might also say I&#8217;m a fan of the great outdoors.

<strong>SSDP: Do you have any advice for other chapter leaders?
</strong>Trevor: Keep going what you&#8217;re doing. Positive thought yields positive action.
