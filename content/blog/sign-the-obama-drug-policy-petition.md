Ideas are fantastic. So why not have an idea machine? SSDP has one and his name is Micah Daigle. His latest idea is a <a href="http://apps.facebook.com/causes/petitions/15">facebook petition</a> that has generated nearly 17,000 signatures. What&#8217;s this petition all about you ask? Well, its calling on President Elect Obama to reform U.S. drug policy.

<h3>We petition that…</h3>
When you called the War on Drugs an &#8220;utter failure&#8221; in 2004, you were right. A 2008 Zogby poll found that 3 out of 4 of Americans agree with you.

When appointing the head of your Office of National Drug Control Policy, please select someone with health, science, or education credentials rather than a military general, law enforcement official, or &#8220;tough on drugs&#8221; politician. The next &#8220;Drug Czar&#8221; should base policy on proven methodology rather than counterproductive ideology. At a minimum, he or she should support these measures:

*Ending the racially unjust disparity in sentencing for crack and powder cocaine.

*Ending the practice of prosecuting patients in states with medical marijuana laws.

*Eliminating the federal law that denies financial aid to students with drug convictions.

We all know that the War on Drugs is failing because handcuffs don&#8217;t cure addictions &#8212; doctors do. You have the opportunity to bring us the change we need. Will you?

Sincerely,
The Undersigned

*Note: By the time I finished writing this, the petition has exceed 17,000 signatures!

Please help us achieve our goal of 20,000 signatures by signing the petition <a href="http://apps.facebook.com/causes/petitions/15">here</a> and<a href="http://www.facebook.com/event.php?eid=47252238337&amp;ref=ts">inviting</a> your friends to sign it.

Yes we can&#8230; have sensible drug policies.
