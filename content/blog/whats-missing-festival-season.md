<em>Written by <a href="https://ssdp.org/bio/amy-hildebrand/">Amy Hildebrand</a> &#8217;16, chapter leader at DePaul University SSDP and our new Illinois State Policy Intern.</em>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The first weekend of August is no normal weekend in Chicago. Locals avoid their beloved methods of public transportation like the plague and don’t dare step within a mile radius of the heart of the city known as the Loop. Metra trains in from the suburbs bring a sea of festival goers to Grant Park for the 4-day mega festival known as <a href="https://www.lollapalooza.com/">Lollapalooza</a>, now in its 26th year. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Originally conceived in 1991 by Jane’s Addiction frontman Perry Farrell, Lollapalooza was to be a touring festival which hoped to expose “Middle America” to a wider variety of music. The first year’s lineup featured Nine Inch Nails and Ice-T’s metal band. Fast forward to 2017 and you’ll find Muse and Mac DeMarco sharing space with Machine Gun Kelly and Migos on stages set against iconic views of the skyline. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">So why does everyone hate on Lollapalooza? (and Coachella, and Bonnaroo…) </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Commercialization and conspicuous, unsafe, consumption. Earlier this festival season, a </span><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/posteverything/wp/2017/04/17/are-there-too-many-music-festivals/?utm_term=.45ab3904cd75"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Washington Post article</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> detailed the corporatization of the music festival scene, one that draws in 32 million people a year in the United States alone. The Post piggybacked off a Paste Magazine article from a year earlier titled “</span><a href="https://www.pastemagazine.com/articles/2016/03/have-we-reached-peak-festival.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Have We Reached Peak Music Festival</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">?” In Paste, author Eric R. Denton writes, “The lineups look increasingly alike&#8230;and it’s starting to seem like we keep going because Instagram photos make them look way more fun than spending a rain-or-shine weekend in an open field with 50,000 other people actually is.”  </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">I’ve heard Lolla described as everything from “Junior Prom” to “an absolute sh*t show,” and I can’t disagree. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">According to the Chicago Tribune, 27 people were arrested and 234 sent to local hospitals. Of the 234 sent to hospitals, the Lurie Children’s Hospital reported 19 minors treated &#8211; down from the 32 last year.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">In upstate Wisconsin, the small, bass-centered festival Infrasound experiences many of the same issues. My roommate, Morgan Daugherty, has attended 6 times. She says &#8211;</span>
<blockquote><span style="font-weight: 400;"> “Artists have said to me that it is strange and uncomfortable to look into the crowd and see people who are clearly unsafely inebriated.” </span></blockquote>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">DePaul SSDP Vice President, Akemi Almeida &#8217;16, attended Infrasound for her first time this summer. She recounted ample harm reduction practices from fellow attendees such as people offering to test drugs. Others were quick to ask her if she was okay when she decided to nap on the ground near the main stage. After comparing experiences, Morgan also noted that this year felt like a noticeable improvement from years past because attendees have taken matters into their own hands to practice harm reduction.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Militant security measures are a whole other set of issues at these events, with attendees often forced into unsafe situations if they choose to ignore prohibited items lists. If someone has just seconds to safely dose and ingest a powdered substance in hopes of concealing themselves from seemingly ever-present security, they may be more prone to taking an amount larger than they had intended. An </span><a href="https://pittnews.com/article/118805/opinions/music-festivals-safety-less-security/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">April 2017 article from Pittnews </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">(University of Pittsburgh’s independent student newspaper) details the need for safety, not security, at music festivals. Clearly, the conversation is happening, and SSDP is well suited to take the reigns in making some impactful changes. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Two things are abundantly clear: people use drugs at music festivals and people want to attend without being distracted by or worried about the people next to them in the crowd. Music festivals need harm reduction. Music festivals need SSDP. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">On site reagent drug testing a la DanceSafe is something to strive for at all music-centered events. Even better would be widespread SSDP presence at events where young people may choose to use drugs. This means more people in our network actively practicing harm reduction in their own lives and social circles before the festival even starts. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The pervasive popularity of festivals and the increasing dialogue about drugs in society are a point of intersection &#8211; a sweet spot harm reductionists can use as a platform to expand our mission. Safety and fun are not mutually exclusive. SSDP’ers know that and we can make music festivals more enjoyable experiences if we help spread that message.</span>
