<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fernando_Henrique_Cardoso">Fernando Henrique Cardoso</a>, former President of Brazil, is<a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2009/sep/06/brazil-cardoso-war-drugs-decriminalisation">calling the war on drugs a failure</a> and advocating for global cannabis decriminalization and the implementation of <a href="http://www.harmreduction.org/">harm reduction</a> policies.

<blockquote>&nbsp;

&#8220;After decades of overflights, interdictions, spraying and raids on jungle drug factories, Latin America remains the world&#8217;s largest exporter of cocaine and marijuana,&#8221; Cardoso writes. &#8220;It is producing more and more opium and heroin. It is developing the capacity to mass produce synthetic drugs. Continuing the drugs war with more of the same is ludicrous.&#8221;

Cardoso, a sociologist, said Argentina, Mexico, Colombia, Bolivia and Ecuador had all now taken steps towards drug law liberalisation and that change was &#8220;imminent&#8221; in Brazil. The way forward worldwide would involve a &#8220;strategy of reaching out, patiently and persistently, to the users and not the continued waging of a misguided and counterproductive war that makes the users, rather than the drug lords, the primary victims,&#8221; he added.</blockquote>
