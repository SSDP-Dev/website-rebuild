Hi again SSDP rockstars!



Here is what&#8217;s new and on the horizon for Students for Sensible Drug Policy.

Leadership transition resources



&nbsp;



It&#8217;s almost the end of the Spring semester, which for a lot of people means you&#8217;ll be moving on to new things. Whether that move is into a new chapter officer position, or walking across the stage at graduation, SSDP has the right solutions for you. Be sure to check out our leadership transition training materials on our website, and join our alumni network to stay in touch after you leave campus.

<i>BELDEN, CALIFORNIA &#8211; Friday August 9-11, 2013 </i>

Last year’s West Coast Campout was such a success that this year our Alumni have started planning it earlier! This time we’re moving inland to the Sierra foothills, where it’s warmer and the water is much more inviting. This is a great event to keep the momentum going through the summer months. The Second Annual West Coast SSDP Regional Campout will be held in beautiful Belden, California. <a href="http://org.salsalabs.com/dia/track.jsp?v=2&amp;c=LgudcCr9WifYhlzrKpo8F04Nz5d%2BMHzk" target="_blank">More information.
