Students for Sensible Drug Policy creates safe spaces for young people to have honest conversations about drugs and the drug war. We think your parents deserve a safe space too.



This mother&#8217;s day, SSDP is teaming up with the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws, the Drug Policy Alliance, Law Enforcement Against Prohibition, and Moms United to End the Drug War for a &#8220;Cops and Moms Week of Action&#8221;. We hope you&#8217;ll take this opportunity to openly discuss drugs and drug policy with your parent(s).



Call your mom today and tell her you support legalizing marijuana.  Maybe she already agrees.  But you won&#8217;t know it unless you try. <a href="http://ssdp.org/action/the-talk" target="_blank"> Go ahead, have &#8220;the talk.&#8221; </a>



<a href="http://ssdp.org/action/the-talk" target="_blank">Once you sign the pledge</a>, we&#8217;ll provide you with a sample phone script to use.
