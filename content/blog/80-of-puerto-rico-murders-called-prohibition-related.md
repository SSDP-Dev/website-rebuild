The title actually read &#8220;<a href="http://laht.com/article.asp?ArticleId=345039&amp;CategoryId=14092">Drug-Related</a>.&#8221; We know better. Just like the U.S-Mexican border, this isn&#8217;t violence caused by people taking drugs and going out on murderous rampages. These murders are fueled by a desire to control the drug trade. Something that is worth quite a bit of money.

Colon also said that keeping an addict incarcerated costs between $28,000 and $30,000 per year, to which must be added other costs pertaining to medical attention when the inmates have AIDS or hepatitis.</blockquote>
The DEA, FBI, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, the U.S. Marshals Service and the Puerto Rico police recently <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5hJNGB63ynFSSxS5VakN4dWZYASlgD9B36L900">arrested 38 people</a> on drug trafficking charges. It&#8217;s estimated that about 30% of illegal drugs coming into the U.S. are coming from Puerto Rico and the islands. There is <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5jFoPQ9L_FgZmUAZtRhc4WqPkfBsQD9ARFL900">good reason for this</a>:

As American soil, it is attractive because drugs leaving here do not have to clear customs to reach the U.S. market.
