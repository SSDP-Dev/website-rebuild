Today is a very big day. <a href="http://ssdp.org/news/blog/marijuana-legalization-bill-to-be-introduced-in-congress" target="_blank">The first marijuana legalization bill was introduced in Congress this afternoon.</a> H.R. 2306, the Ending Federal Marijuana Prohibition Act of 2011, is a bi-partisan bill introduced by Congressmen Barney Frank and Ron Paul that would allow states to legalize and regulate marijuana without federal interference.



As a marijuana lobbyist working the halls of Congress, I had lots of conversations with elected officials about legalization.  I can&#8217;t tell you how many times I&#8217;ve heard a Representative or Senator say, &#8220;I agree with you, but I just don&#8217;t think my constituents do.&#8221;



I always respond the same way: &#8220;Senator, more of your constituents support legalizing marijuana than you&#8217;ll ever know, and you&#8217;ll actually get <em>more</em> votes if you talk honestly about it.&#8221;



<strong><a href="http://ssdp.org/action/support-federal-marijuana-legalization">Help show the breadth of our support by sending a letter to Congress now.</a></strong>

Most elected officials support changing our marijuana laws whether they admit it or not. After all, they are only human.  How many times have you thought about bringing up marijuana legalization with your friend, your co-worker, or your mother, only to censor yourself because you think you&#8217;re alone or because it seems like a taboo subject?



The only reason more elected officials don&#8217;t take a stand is because they think they&#8217;re alone. But we&#8217;re now at a tipping point. It&#8217;s our job to show them that a solid majority of Americans are actually with us — and them.



This spring, more than 400 students came to the Capitol for our 2011 Training Conference and Lobby Day to generate support for this legislation. They helped embolden members of Congress to take a stand on legalizing marijuana.



<strong>These students stood up and spoke truth to power.  Will you?</strong>



<a href="http://ssdp.org/action/support-federal-marijuana-legalization" target="_blank">Please help me today.</a> This moment is historic. It&#8217;s too important to pass up.



Thanks so much,



Aaron
