<strong id="internal-source-marker_0.47291913302615285">As a student organization, having funding makes a tremendous difference in the ability to organize successfully and accomplish your goals.

If your chapter is recognized by your school, you likely have the opportunity to apply for university funding through your student government, activities board or other funding body. If you haven’t already, you should definitely look into submitting a chapter budget proposal.



If university funding isn’t an option, you will have to raise the money as a chapter through events, campaigns, or online efforts. The thought of raising hundreds or thousands of dollars may seem daunting at first, but it’s actually easier than you might think. There are tons of creative ways to raise money in today’s day and age. Here are a few recommendations you should consider that have been successful for SSDP chapters in the past:
