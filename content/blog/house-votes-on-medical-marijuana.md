In the first Federal vote on medical marijuana in the House since 2007, tonight the House voted 262-163 against the Rohrabacher-Hinchey-McClintock-Farr amendment (<a href="http://ssdp.org/assets/files/docs/RHF-Amendment.pdf" target="_blank">read the full text here</a>). This amendment would have banned the use of Federal funds to prevent States from implementing their own state laws that authorize use, distribution, possession, or cultivation of medical marijuana in the 16 states and the District of Columbia where medical marijuana is legal.



The result is unsurprising to advocates, given that a similar amendment in 2007 was defeated 262-165. However, it&#8217;s encouraging to see 27 Republicans voting in favor, as opposed to only 15 aye votes from Republicans in 2007.  Additionally, 71 percent of the House Democratic Caucus supported medical marijuana and wanted to stop the Obama Administration’s raids!



Thanks to everyone who took action by writing and/or calling Congress over the past few days. Stay tuned for future updates on this issue and for how you can help put an end to the Federal war on medical marijuana.



Until then, the fight continues&#8230;
