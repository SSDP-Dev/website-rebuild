SSDP at SCSU is only two weeks old, but they are already off to an impressive start. Kevin Gysberg founded the chapter with the intention of reforming his campus&#8217;s drug and alcohol policy, and that&#8217;s exactly what he has begun to do. Despite their fresh start, Kevin and the rest of the students in the SCSU chapter have already drafted new legislation to equalize cannabis and underage alcohol possession violations; and it&#8217;s shaking things up on campus. Kevin believes the school is harsh on cannabis mostly because it’s looked down on by society, but knows cannabis is actually safer than alcohol. Students at SCSU are supportive of  enacting an equalization policy, but the campus administration doesn&#8217;t seem open to changing the status quo.
