<span style="font-weight: 400"> In mainstream conversations about families and drugs, parents are tasked with protecting their children from the evils of drug abuse. However, this narrative drastically oversimplifies the many ways in which families experience drugs and drug use, glossing over the serious problems caused by drug war policies themselves.
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">
Even otherwise positive drug policy reforms frequently overlook parents and families, perpetuating the harms done by the War on Drugs.
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">
This issue of the <a href="http://ssdp.org/news/blog/tag/monthly-mosaic/">Monthly Mosaic</a> will touch on a few of the ways families are impacted by drug policy. </span>

<h2><b>Medical Cannabis &amp; Child Custody</b></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400">A total of </span><a href="http://www.ncsl.org/research/health/state-medical-marijuana-laws.aspx"><span style="font-weight: 400">25 states, the District of Columbia and Guam currently have medical marijuana or recreational cannabis legislation</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">, and an additional </span><a href="http://www.ncsl.org/research/health/state-medical-marijuana-laws.aspx"><span style="font-weight: 400">17 states allow the use of &#8220;low THC, high cannabidiol (CBD)&#8221; products for medical reasons in limited situations or as a legal defense</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">. While these advances are certainly admirable, families have been left behind. </span><span style="font-weight: 400">Even though the majority of the country has now legalized cannabinoid ingestion in  some form, parents—even those in legal compliance—continue to be threatened with losing  custody of their children, or worse. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">In June 2015, police entered San Diego medical cannabis patient </span><a href="http://www.safeaccesssd.com/2016/06/4287.html"><span style="font-weight: 400">Micah Wojnowski</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">’s home with guns drawn, based on a tip from a confidential informant. </span><a href="http://www.safeaccesssd.com/2016/06/4287.html"><span style="font-weight: 400">Accused of</span><span style="font-weight: 400"> manufacturing concentrated cannabis and felony child endangerment charges</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">, Micah was dragged into court. </span>

&nbsp;
<blockquote><b>“San Diego police officers stormed past medical cannabis patient Micah Wojnowski’s organic vegetable farm in Golden Hill and into the home he shared with his teenage son and a couple of roommates.  The police entered the urban home with guns drawn on a tip from a confidential informant. </b><b>They did not find what they were looking for</b><b> but decided not to accept defeat. Instead they searched Micah’s house and garage, and </b><b>set a stage to paint Micah as a child abuser because he is a medical cannabis patient, an industry expert and a parent.</b><b>”</b></blockquote>

Although Micah was thankfully found not guilty, his experience is unfortunately not unique.

<blockquote><b>“It started in March 2015 when Shona’s 11-year-old son was attending a ‘drug education program’ [at school]&#8230;After making a comment relating to Shona’s medical cannabis use for Crohn’s disease, </b><b>school officials called The Department of Children and Families and the Garden City police</b><b>. Authorities proceeded to interview Shona’s son without her permission. Using this information, which was possibly gained illegally, they raided Shona’s home while she was not there and found cannabis. In June, Shona was charged with various drug and child endangerment crimes, whereupon she turned herself into authorities. Even more devastatingly, </b><b>Shona’s son was taken away by the state </b><b>when they opened a Child in Need of Care (CINC) case.”</b></blockquote>

<span style="font-weight: 400">Shona and Micah represent just a few of many parents who have faced the risk of being labeled child abusers and losing custody of their kids for using cannabis for medical purposes.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">Cannabis legislation and ballot initiatives offer weak parent-protective provisions, or none at all, which allows CPS to continue to take action against parents who use cannabis legally. However, organizations like the </span><a href="http://flcalliance.org/about/mission-statement/"><span style="font-weight: 400">Family Law and Cannabis Alliance</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> are fighting back with  </span><a href="http://flcalliance.org/resources/parent-protective-model-language/"><span style="font-weight: 400">model language</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> for ballot initiatives and other legislation that liberalize cannabis laws while providing protection for families.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">Children are routinely separated from their imprisoned mothers</span><span style="font-weight: 400">, causing </span><a href="http://www.drugpolicy.org/resource/women-prison-and-drug-war"><span style="font-weight: 400">irreparable damage to the child</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">Two states in particular—</span><a href="http://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/tennessee-discontinues-controversial-fetal-assault-law/"><span style="font-weight: 400">Tennessee</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> and </span><a href="http://www.thekindland.com/smoking-weed-while-pregnant-can-land-you-in-prison-1325"><span style="font-weight: 400">Alabama</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">—have garnered a lot of attention for passing controversial first-in-the-nation laws that target pregnant drug users. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">Involuntary or coerced treatment is another common sanction for those who use drugs during pregnancy, even though </span><a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10710986"><span style="font-weight: 400">studies suggest that mandatory treatment is not a good predictor of positive treatment outcomes</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">.</span>
