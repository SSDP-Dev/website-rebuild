<h1><span style="font-weight: 400;">What is Support Don’t Punish?</span></h1>
<b>Support. Don’t Punish.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is a global advocacy campaign that seeks to raise awareness of the harms being caused by the War on Drugs. The campaign aims to promote drug policies that respect human rights and protect public health, to change laws and policies that impede access to harm reduction interventions and other evidence-based services, and to end the criminalization of people who use drugs. </span><a href="http://supportdontpunish.org/about/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">To view the campaign’s primary messages, visit their website.</span></a>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The campaign creates visibility and awareness over both global issues facing people who use drugs and also local campaigns in areas where events are organized. There are three primary components to the campaign:</span>
<ul>
 	<li><b>Social Media Engagement<span style="font-weight: 400;">: Using #SupportDontPunish, everyone is encouraged to post photos, articles, and news stories relevant to the campaign’s messages both on June 26th and the days leading up to it. Follow @SDPcampaign on twitter as well as the official </span><a href="https://www.facebook.com/supportdontpunish"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Facebook Page.</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> You can also change your </span><a href="http://supportdontpunish.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/sdp_cover_photo.png"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Facebook cover photo</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for the day. </span></b></li>
 	<li><a href="http://supportdontpunish.org/photoproject/"><b>Photo Project:</b></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> A key part of the campaign is an interactive photo project that anyone with a camera can participate in. Just download the </span><a href="http://supportdontpunish.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/SUPPORT-DONT-PUNISH-POSTER.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;">campaign poster</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">take your photo and then send it to </span><a href="mailto:campaign@idpc.net"><span style="font-weight: 400;">campaign@idpc.net</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to be uploaded on the website, </span><a href="https://www.facebook.com/supportdontpunish?ref=hl"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Facebook</span></a> <span style="font-weight: 400;">and on </span><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/90322037@N05/sets/72157638043747894/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Flickr</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></li>
 	<li><b>Global Day of Action: <span style="font-weight: 400;">On June 26th, join thousands of activists worldwide by organizing or participating in an action in your city calling for an end to the global drug war. Actions can range from public demonstrations, to film screenings, to street art/performances, to academic events. </span></b></li>
</ul>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">In previous years, SSDP chapters across the world have organized actions and contributed to the campaign’s photo project. Here are some examples of what chapters have done in the past:</span>

 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2015, </span><a href="http://ssdp.org/news/blog/ssdp-participates-in-the-support-dont-punish-global-day-of-action/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">SSDP organized a march in Washington, DC</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that called on the US State Department to</span></span>

 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">SSDP chapters in Ireland organized a </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">rally in Dublin in 2015 </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">where the Irish Minister for Drug Strategies publically declared his support for the decriminalization of all drugs for the first time. </span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/pg/Ssdpghana/photos/?tab=album&amp;album_id=1027297770640287"><span style="font-weight: 400;">SSDP Ghana brought together their various chapters f</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">or a day of awareness in 2016 where they called attention to the stigmatization of people who use drugs in Ghana.</span></li>

<h2><b>Why June 26th?</b></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">June 26th is the United Nations’ International Day Against Drug Abuse and Illicit Trafficking – a day when many governments celebrate their contributions to the global ‘War on Drugs’. In the past, some governments have even commemorated this day by holding public executions or beatings of drug offenders. By taking part in the Global Day of Action, you can help “reclaim” this message on this important day.</span>
<h1><span style="font-weight: 400;">How Do I Get Involved?</span></h1>
<h2><b>Participate in a Local Action</b></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">If you live near a major city or large population area and want to see if there is already an event being planned near you, contact </span><a href="mailto:jake@ssdp.org"><span style="font-weight: 400;">jake@ssdp.org</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, or check out the official </span><a href="http://supportdontpunish.org/day-of-action-2018/"><b>2018 Day of Action page</b></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. We will let you know when the action is planned for, what is going on, and who to contact about getting involved. </span>
<h2><b>Organize an Event</b></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">If you do not live near a location where a </span>Support. Don’t Punish<span style="font-weight: 400;"> event is already being planned, then organize one yourself! </span><a href="http://supportdontpunish.org/resources/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The campaign&#8217;s website has plenty of resources in a variety of languages to help you get started</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The aim for the Global Day of Action is to produce high-profile and visually symbolic local actions. It is your choice to decide what these actions are. The only requirement is that these actions are connected to the global campaign by using the </span><a href="http://supportdontpunish.org/campaign-logos/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Support. Don’t Punish logo (available in several different languages)</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. This could be on t-shirts, banners, posters, reports or other materials. This allows us to tie together the local actions and to demonstrate that they are all part of a coordinated global effort. Also be sure to include the <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0B7fh6jX33lH5YlRYM05tMzc2RFU">SSDP logo</a> on any materials you make.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">If you decide to organize an action, let us know about it by e-mailing </span><a href="mailto:jake@ssdp.org"><span style="font-weight: 400;">jake@ssdp.org</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you are looking for inspiration about what to do, have a look at the actions that took place in</span> <a href="http://supportdontpunish.org/day-of-action-2013/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">2013</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="http://supportdontpunish.org/day-of-action-2014/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">2014</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="http://supportdontpunish.org/day-of-action-2015/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">2015, </span></a><a href="http://supportdontpunish.org/day-of-action-2016/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">2016</span></a> and <a href="http://supportdontpunish.org/day-of-action-2017/">2017</a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span>
