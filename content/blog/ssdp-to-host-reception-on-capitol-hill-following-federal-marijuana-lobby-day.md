<p dir="ltr">I am excited to announce that Students for Sensible Drug Policy will be holding a <a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/387400121364723/?ref=notif&amp;notif_t=plan_user_joined">reception on Capitol Hill</a> next Monday, June 17th, at the conclusion of our <a href="http://ssdp.org/events/federal-marijuana-lobby-day/">Federal Marijuana Lobby Day</a> featuring special guest speakers Congressman Jared Polis (D-CO) and conservative stalwart Grover Norquist.</p>

<p dir="ltr">As we join together on the Capitol grounds, we aim to bring together some of our top student activists, alumni, and supporters from both sides of the aisle to celebrate our day of activism, share our lobbying experiences, and hear from several prominent speakers on the issue of marijuana policy reform.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Our movement faces a critical time to pass legislation that could change marijuana enforcement strategies in key reform states, and marshaling strong bi-partisan support has never been more important for moving legislation through Congress. That&#8217;s why SSDP is proud to bring together national leaders from all across the political spectrum who agree on one thing: the government&#8217;s prohibition of marijuana has failed.</p>

<p dir="ltr">We hope you can join us to celebrate this exciting day, and meet some of our top students from around the country. Refreshments will be provided through generous sponsorship by the Silver Tour and Robert Platshorn. Our lobby day is made possible by generous support from the Drug Policy Alliance. We look forward to seeing you there!</p>

Where: Room B369 in the Rayburn House Office Building.

When: 4:00pm-6:00pm
