Over the past month, I&#8217;ve had the pleasure of working Sky Santiago, our newest chapter leader from Indiana University South Bend. Her chapter recently became fully established, so in celebration, I asked her to tell us a little more about her plans for the future.

<strong>

How did you hear about SSDP?</strong><strong>
</strong>I heard about SSDP through MAPS (Multidisciplinary  Association for Psychedelic Studies).

</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div><strong>Why did you want to get involved/what made you decide to start a chapter?</strong></div>
<div>I am taking a grad-level class called &#8220;Marijuana Controversies: Mass Incarceration&#8221; and I learned about the social injustice issues and got more intrigued. I decided that this issue is &#8220;everything,&#8221; just like the SSDP Powerpoint says, and it could be a catalyst for much needed change in the USA.</div>
<div></div>
<div><strong>What has the reception been like on campus? From students, teachers, administration, etc.</strong></div>
<div>Our class is very interested and even various faculty and staff members of the university have expressed support. More challenging is student involvement&#8211;I think due to it being new and perhaps even controversial. Once we can educate more people I see it could be a big (good) deal on campus.</div>
<div></div>
<div><strong>What are some of the things you have planned or want to plan for next semester?</strong></div>
<div>We are currently meeting with the local civil rights center to put together a symposium for marijuana decriminalization and medicinal use.</div>
<div></div>
<div><strong>What is the most challenging part of your experience starting/running the chapter so far?</strong><strong> </strong></div>
<div>Student involvement, and commitment. I want to start a movement, and have to first get people &#8220;moved&#8221;!</div>
<div></div>
<div><strong>What is the most rewarding part?</strong></div>
<div>Knowing I am working on an issue that has huge social, economic, and racial issues surrounding it.</div>
<div></div>
<div><strong>What are you most excited about for your chapter/school/state/region/<wbr />ssdp/drug policy right now?</strong></div>
<div>We want to help decriminalize and bring about medicinal use in Indiana&#8211;what a challenge and a great potential for this state.</div>
<div></div>
<div><strong>What is your vision for Indiana University South Bend SSDP? Where do you see your chapter in a year? in 4 or 5 years?</strong></div>
<div>I see us as a catalyst for community and regional education, and eventual joining along others statewide for policy change. Hopefull the student group will live on after I graduate and continue to be the campus voice on this issue.</div>
