These events serve to unite the SSDP chapter network for a day of training, workshops, discussion, networking, and expert presentations aimed to help us refine our skills as advocates for ending the destructive war on drugs.  Interactive sessions and workshops will be led by <strong>Aaron Houston</strong>, <strong>Stacia Cosner</strong>, <strong>Drew Stromberg</strong>, and <strong>Devon Tackels</strong> of the SSDP national staff. The staff will guide participants through activities that address and practice lobbying skills, changing campus policies, getting officials on the record, working with the press, managing volunteers, recruiting, fundraising, event planning, and more!



Participants will also hear from keynote speakers and meet other students, alumni and other supporters during networking social events.



Registration is now open for these three exciting SSDP training events! The $25 fee includes entry to the event, breakfast, a name tag, and printed materials.
