Despite the Department of Justice memo advising the DEA and federal prosecutors not to spend resources arresting medical marijuana patients and raiding medical marijuana providers in states that have passed legislation protecting these people, federal agents have recently shut down 26 medical cannabis dispensaries in Montana and California.

Just Say Now, SSDP&#8217;s partnership with Firedoglake has written a <a href="http://action.firedoglake.com/page/m/5958d523/4597600b/63e20bb8/3dc640b4/620163066/VEsC/" target="_blank">letter telling Attorney General Holder to enforce his memo and prohibit federal raids on medical marijuana dispensaries.</a> We want you to sign on to the letter.

As Attorney General, Holder has the ability to enforce his memo and end these raids. He should send a strong message that federal law enforcement resources should not be abused and wasted to override state&#8217;s rights.
