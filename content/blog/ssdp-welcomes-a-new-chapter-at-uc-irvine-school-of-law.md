This month, SSDP gained another chapter at the <a href="http://ssdp.org/chapters/west-coast/california/university-of-california-irvine-school-of-law/">University of California (UC) Irvine School of Law</a>! UC &#8211; Irvine School of Law will join <a href="http://ssdp.org/law/">our other law school chapters</a> to address the harms and failures of the drug war from a legal and academic perspective. Being a law student gives you a unique perspective to address the drug war and take action on campus, and that is just what chapter leader, Lauren Mendelsohn, plans to do. I had the chance to catch up with Lauren last week to discuss her chapter start-up in depth, and here is what Lauren had to say about her involvement in SSDP so far.

<strong>How did you first hear about SSDP?</strong>



I heard about SSDP as an undergraduate at the University of Maryland. I was very involved with the chapter there and served as president and outreach director before graduating in 2013.



<strong>What made you want to get involved in the drug policy reform movement?</strong>

Logic. I couldn&#8217;t understand why people could endorse policies that are unjust, costly, ineffective, and based in hearsay. I felt obligated to educate others and to advocate for progressive changes.



<strong>How has the reception on campus been so far?</strong>

Fantastic! Students and faculty alike are excited for the new perspective SSDP will bring to the law school community.



<strong>What are some events and campaigns you have planned for your chapter?</strong>

Nothing’s set in stone yet, but ultimately I would like to host networking events with local attorneys working in criminal defense, public policy, and related areas of law that LSSDP chapter members might consider as a career. We also hope to have speaker panels and debates.



<strong>What is the most challenging part of your experience founding and/or running the chapter so far?</strong>

Time &#8211; there just isn’t enough of it anymore!



<strong>What is the most rewarding part?</strong>

Being able to stay involved with Students for Sensible Drug Policy for another few years, and knowing that I extended LSSDP’s reach to the Los Angeles area.



<strong>What are you most excited about for your chapter right now?</strong>

Getting off the ground! UCI Law is a young school so there’s a big push for students to get involved with organizations.



<strong>What is your vision for UCI LSSDP? What do you see your chapter accomplishing in the future?</strong>

<p style="text-align: left;">I’m hopeful the chapter will have a lasting and positive impression on the law school. UCI LSSDP will encourage students to be activists for justice, and will provide a progressive outlook in conservative Orange County. On a more concrete note, UC Irvine lacks a campus-wide Good Samaritan Policy, so that is a campaign I hope to take on at some point.
