New York’s stop-and-frisk policy has seen the New York City police stop an estimated 5 million people in the past decade. Though about 9 out of 10 have walked away without consequence from the stop, the stop-and-frisks have overwhelmingly targeted young African American and Hispanic men. Scheindlin ruled that the practice violates both the 4<sup>th</sup> and 14<sup>th</sup> amendments to the Constitution, stating that stop-and-frisks <a href="http://ssdp.org/resources/know-your-rights/" target="_blank">violate rights </a>to privacy and equal protection under the law.



This ruling, and mandated reform of the police policy, is a victory for sensible drug policy. SSDP has long <a href="http://ssdp.org/news/blog/one-million-police-hours-spent-on-marijuana-arrests-in-nyc/" target="_blank">criticized stop-and-frisk</a> practices for their violations of privacy and for their targeting of young people of color. Reforming the practice will stop unjust violations of privacy and racial profiling, and is a key first step on the road to more sensible policy.
