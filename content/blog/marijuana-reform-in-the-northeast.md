Last night, <a title="Governor Chafee signed Rhode Island’s decriminalization bill into law" href="http://news.providencejournal.com/breaking-news/2012/06/ri-gov-chafee-s-6.html" target="_blank">Governor Chafee signed Rhode Island’s decriminalization bill into law</a>, officially making the Ocean State the <a title="15th state" href="http://norml.org/marijuana/personal/item/states-that-have-decriminalized" target="_blank">15th state</a> to pass marijuana decriminalization. With this new legislation, possession of up to one ounce of marijuana by any individual 18 years or older will result in a non-arrestable civil offense punishable by a $150 fine. This means no jail time, no criminal records, and no more lives ruined by the stain of a marijuana arrest and conviction on their record. This new legislation takes effect April 1, 2013.



To make things even more interesting, just hours after Chafee signed Rhode Island’s reformed marijuana policy, the <a title="NY State Assembly" href="http://www.examiner.com/article/new-york-state-assembly-passes-medical-marijuana-bill" target="_blank">New York State assembly voted</a> to pass <a title="AB 7347" href="http://assembly.state.ny.us/leg/?default_fld=%0D%0At&amp;bn=a7347&amp;term=2011&amp;Summary=Y" target="_blank">AB 7347</a>, which would allow qualified patients to use marijuana for medical purposes, in a 90-50 vote. This isn’t the first time medical marijuana has passed in New York, but in the past the bills have gotten held up in the State Senate. So, if you are a New York resident, <a title="Contact your Senator" href="http://ssdp.org/action/tell-the-new-york-senate-to-support-medical-marijuana/" target="_blank">please contact your State Senator</a> and ask them to support compassion today.
