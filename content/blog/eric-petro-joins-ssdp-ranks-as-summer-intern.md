This isn&#8217;t my first time staying in Washington, D.C., but no matter how comfortable I get with recognizing street names or navigating the metro, I can&#8217;t help feeling intimidated as I pass the Capitol or stroll down K Street. This intimidation factor is no mistake, but it can be overcome. In the words of those great musicians from across the pond, &#8220;I get by with a little help from my friends.&#8221;



Students for Sensible Drug Policy is that friend. An organization that harvests the energy of politically aware students from all across the world, SSDP serves to unite their voices and make a difference in (pardon the clich√©) the democratic way that the founding fathers intended.



I know what it&#8217;s like to be that student. Starting political activist groups in a small liberal arts college in the Midwest, sitting at a table and passing out literature to a largely apathetic student body, wishing more students would be interested in being the change that most of them ideally want to see. That experience is why I feel so empowered that there are groups like SSDP that organize those active students, and why I am beyond stoked to join SSDP command center in Washington to be that change.
