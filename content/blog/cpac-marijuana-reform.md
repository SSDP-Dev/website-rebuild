This past week, the <a href="http://cpac2012.conservative.org/">Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC)</a> drew thousands of politically active minds to Washington, DC to highlight the discourse on the right side of the aisle. Each year, CPAC attracts more and more young people, students in particular, and this year there was noticeably stronger support and willingness to talk about reforming our nations’ drug policies among the those in attendance. Now, we know students have been talking about drug policy reform for years, but it seems that <a href="http://campusprogress.org/">Campus Progress</a>, a national organization that works with young people to promote progressive solutions, was a little surprised to hear young conservatives talking, well, progressively. So much so, that they published this video, entitled <a href="http://campusprogress.org/articles/cpac_2012_the_surprisingly_progressive_edition/">“CPAC 2012: The ‘Surprisingly Progressive’ Edition”</a>, where students talk about the issues that matter most to them.  The highlight for SSDP, was hearing “I do think that marijuana and substances of that nature should be legalized. I actually wrote a 37 page paper for one of my college classes on legalization and taxation, and how it can help individual states and the nation as a whole.”, said Matt, a student from the conservative heart of Texas. It goes to show that reforming our national drug policy is something youth voters on both sides of the aisle care about. Watch more below.
