The drug war continues to wreak havoc on the lives of U.S. citizens. It continues to wreak havoc on the lives of non-U.S. citizens, too. But we just heard of this case of an Oklahoma woman being sent to prison for a decade for dealing marijuana in front of her children; the grandmother has received a non-custodial sentence, but still has to submit to regular drug testing. You can read just how bloody-minded and unforgiving the prosecutors in the case were. The article doesn&#8217;t even explain how non-existent or awful the defense team was, even though there are clear problems for the women the moment they were arrested.



The case is from Taft, OK, and the full story may be foundÂ <a href="http://www.newsok.com/article/3542585" target="_blank">here</a>.



There are different dynamics in other cases of unjust imprisonment, but should you want examples which would embolden your understanding of systematic injustice, appraise yourself of the story of Tulia, Texas. And when you finish with Tulia, take a look at Hearne, TX. And when you are done with those stories, why not take a look at LA&#8217;s Ramparts Division and the crisis that unit endured regarding corruption charges. And even if that doesn&#8217;t explain to you how wrong this situation is, just look up Gary Webb on Wikipedia and have a look at his &#8220;Dark Alliance&#8221; series. If you don&#8217;t know about Webb, then you really don&#8217;t understand the fatal dynamics of anti-drug war commentary and fact finding. You don&#8217;t understand how the drug wars systematize oppression.



And if you want to thank anything or anybody for this situation, then why not ask the architects, proponents, and sustainers of the drug wars &#8212; for instance, the presidents in the Americas who coyly suggest a debate on drug legalization, but then back away from that debate &#8212; as to how and why they can put their fellow citizens and human beings through such misery? And at such cost to the public purse.



In any event, one woman in Oklahoma just began a decade-long custodial sentence for less than $50.00 of pot. If this were Denmark, and I were Shakespeare, I would be screaming that this state is rotten. And it may be rotten to the core&#8230;
