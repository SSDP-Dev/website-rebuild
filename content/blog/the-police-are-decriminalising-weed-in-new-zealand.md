<em>This blog post was written by Victoria University of Wellington chapter leader Cameron Price, and also appears on <a href="http://salient.org.nz/2015/07/the-police-are-decriminalising-weed-in-new-zealand/" target="_blank">Salient.org.nz</a>.</em>

Chris Fowlie is the head of the National Organisation for the Reform of Marijuana Laws (NORML) and he <i>really </i>doesn’t like the way the police enforce the Misuse of Drugs Act. In a recent post on <i>The Daily Blog</i>, he argued that the authorities maliciously target harmless dope smokers, causing them far more harm than a joint ever could.

The statistics he cites appear to back up his argument: since 1994 there have been nearly half a million drug arrests, accounting for 11 per cent of all recorded crime. 85 per cent of the arrests were for cannabis, and 87 per cent of those were for personal amounts. On average, that equates to the police arresting 15,800 users a year for possession of personal amounts of pot. That’s 43 a day, or one every 33 minutes.<img class=" size-medium wp-image-16232 alignleft" src="http://ssdp.org/assets/Screen-Shot-2015-07-21-at-5.45.34-PM-300x235.png" alt="Screen Shot 2015-07-21 at 5.45.34 PM" width="300" height="235" />

Fowlie says these statistics “are illustrative of how drug policing in New Zealand has gone off the rails”. But actually, the opposite is true: a closer look at the data shows that in fact there has been a huge decline in police arrests for possession and use <i>over time</i>. In averaging out arrests over two decades, Fowlie focusses on the noise and misses the signal.
