Nonprofit Printing by PrintRunner is an outreach program for NPOs that provides 10% discount to nonprofit organizations. As an organization concerned with the effect of drug abuse in the community, the students involved in this mission are worthy of support. Part of the SSDP’s mission is considering safety of the students and youth in drug reforms. By empowering the youth, there is a better chance of understanding the situation and gaining participation to voice out messages that help in achieving sensible drug policy.

<a href="http://ssdp.org/about/faqs/">SSDP’s accomplishments</a> for the community about drug reforms are indeed a great milestone for an organization. They continue to grow and reach out to hundreds of campuses across North America. One of SSDP’s successful campaigns is the youth representation at the International Forum on March 2012. Students and youth representatives from Poland, Mexico and Columbia played an important role in United Nations Commission on Narcotic Drugs with special consultative status.  Activity and campaign like this empowers the youth from having voice at the United Nations. The organization’s efforts are continuously being heard through the media from USA Today, The Los Angeles Times, Fox News, CNN, campus newspapers and other organizations.



Since SSDP is the only drug policy reform organization led by students where youths are active in leadership, their influence for youth empowerment is remarkable and worth recognizing. As an approved organization for <a href="http://csr.printrunner.com/nonprofit/">Nonprofit Printing by PrintRunner</a>, they will continue to get printing discounts and printing assistance from the company.
