<p style="color: #222222;">When I was counsel to the U.S. House of Representatives Committee on the Judiciary in the 1980s, I had a front-row seat to the buildup of the War on Drugs. And since 1989, I&#8217;ve been fighting on the front lines to end that war through my work at the Criminal Justice Policy Foundation and as a board member and adviser to many drug policy reform organizations.</p>

When I first became an adviser to SSDP in 1999, and in 2004 accepted a seat on the Board of Directors, it was because I understood the importance of empowering the transformative voice of young people. SSDP does not simply organize protest of the War on Drugs, it teaches students the skills to become <span class="aBn" tabindex="0" data-term="goog_1453344743"><span class="aQJ">tomorrow&#8217;s</span></span> civic leaders. Members don&#8217;t learn political theory, they practice politics. They lobby in state capitols and in Washington, D.C. They write op-eds and letters to the editor. They make documentaries and YouTube videos. They run for student senate and get elected. They get trained to give media interviews, and then give them. All along the way they&#8217;ve changed policy in cities, states and on many campuses.
