This past weekend, Roosevelt University hosted the 2011 Midwest Regional SSDP Conference in Chicago, Illinois. The conference gathered students, alumni, professional drug policy reformers, journalists, and health professionals together in order to help educate and train attendees to become better advocates in ending the War on Drugs. With over 60 students, from 10 established SSDP chapters and 5 chapters in progress, our generation was represented by some of the brightest minds in the country. With students representing high schools, colleges, and universities from five different states, this event served as a guiding light for so many young activists. Seeing such a great turnout from a region that is not often seen as a haven for drug policy reform left attendees inspired to take their newly honed skills and knowledge back to their campuses and communities to enact change.

Partnering with the Mansfield Institute for Social Justice, Roosevelt SSDP worked to put together a very diverse set of speakers, panels, and presentations for attendees to help create an open forum for discussing sensible alternatives to our nation’s current drug policies. This event accomplished SSDP’s intentions by helping create a forum that discussed the collateral consequences of the War on Drugs, why student involvement is so important, and how we can work to craft future drug policies grounded in science, reason, compassion, and justice. The conference opened the floor to many topics and allowed students to discuss issues like racial disparities within current drug policy, harm reduction, state funding priorities, and marijuana policy reform.

After leaving the conference, I remain totally inspired by the amount of energy, passion, and direction I witnessed take place in Chicago. Seeing the level of intellectual discourse, hearing the heartfelt testimonies, and talking to so many inspiring individuals, I can only see success in the future of the Midwest’s drug policy reform.
