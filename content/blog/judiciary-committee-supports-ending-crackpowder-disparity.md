Just days ago, the <a href="http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/paperchase/2009/07/house-committee-passes-bill-to.php">U.S. House Judiciary Committee</a> voted 16-9 in favor of a bill that would eliminate the <a href="http://www.drugpolicy.org/drugwar/mandatorymin/crackpowder.cfm">100-to-1 sentencing disparity</a> between crack and powder cocaine offenses. The disparity in <a href="http://www.famm.org/UnderstandSentencing/WhatAreMandatoryMinimums.aspx">mandatory sentences</a> has resulted in a disproportionate number of African-Americans being sentenced to lengthy prison stays for crack offenses, despite most cocaine users being white, without the drug&#8217;s availability being significantly reduced.

Under current law, five grams of crack cocaine and 500 grams of powder cocaine trigger the same five-year sentence. Fifty grams of crack cocaine and five kilograms of powder cocaine trigger the same 10-year sentence. If H.R. 3245 becomes law, crack and powder cocaine mandatory minimums will be equal: 500 grams will require five years and 5 kilos (or 5,000 grams) will require 10 years, no matter what form of cocaine is involved.

On November 21, 2008, <a href="http://www.ssdp.org/">Students for Sensible Drug Policy</a> sent more than 200 students to Capitol Hill to lobby their representatives to support equalizing the disparity &#8211; proof young people can make a difference!

<a href="http://www.famm.org/ProfilesofInjustice/FederalProfiles/HamedahHasan.aspx">Hamedah Hasan</a> is an example of someone who has spent the past 16 years in prison due to mandatory-minimum sentencing. She was scheduled to be released last month until her case judge &#8220;changed her mind.&#8221;
