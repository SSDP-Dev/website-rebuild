Here&#8217;s <a href="http://www.maddvirgindrinks.com/">an example</a> of an attempt at harm-reduction gone terribly wrong:
<blockquote>MADD announces an exclusive license agreement with Hill Street Marketing Inc. to produce a line of alcohol-free beverages, MADD Virgin Drinks, which will provide American consumers with a delicious and socially responsible alternative to alcoholic beverages.</blockquote>

Cool. I&#8217;m down with non-alcoholic beverages (although I prefer a nice, frosty, alcoholic Guinness myself). I&#8217;m definitely NOT down with drunk driving. But whatever you think about alcohol, MADD, or this campaign, you have to admit that dubbing these beverages &#8220;virgin&#8221; is just a dumb marketing move.

After all, if you&#8217;re trying to get 19 year old college guys to buy your product, you&#8217;re not going to have much luck asking them to carry a bottle around a party with the word &#8220;virgin&#8221; on it.

Once again, this shows that MADD is entirely out of touch with the constituency they claim to protect, and is more interested in promoting prohibitionist, puritanical &#8220;values&#8221; than actually saving lives. They&#8217;ve made a product that might be popular with the already-cautious &#8220;abstinence-only&#8221; crowd, but will do nothing to actually reach those who are most likely to engage in risky behavior.

Whether or not you&#8217;re a virgin, SSDP strongly recommends that you stay safe and sensible by carrying around some <a href="http://ssdp.org/donate">Screw the Drug War condoms</a>&#8230; just in case.
