The One Hitters is a co-ed, DC-based recreational softball team in the Congressional Softball League. Sponsored by <a href="http://mtnmeds.com/" target="_blank">Mountain Medicine</a>, the team comprises players who work for or support marijuana and other drug policy reform through organizations such as Students for Sensible Drug Policy, the Marijuana Policy Project, and Americans for Safe Access, among others.
<p dir="ltr">Founded around 2002, the One Hitters has been known to cause a stir due to the controversial nature of their work, and more recently, their impressive record on the field (they ended the 2013 season with 13 wins and 3 losses, ranking them 5th out of approximately 80 teams in the league). From time to time, <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/06/20/marijuana-white-house-softball_n_3472834.html" target="_blank">the media has taken notice</a> of the One Hitters, especially when the team faced off (and defeated) the White House softball team once in 2012 and once in 2013, even being mentioned by Jay Leno, Jimmy Fallon, <img class="alignright wp-image-12990 size-medium" src="/assets/one_hitters-300x300.jpg" alt="one_hitters" width="300" height="300" />and Bill Maher.</p>
