The <a href="http://www.ssdp.org/amplify">AMPLIFY Project</a> is a side project of Students for Sensible Drug Policy that connects dedicated activists with artists who support our mission to reform failed drug policies and allow us to spread harm reduction within the live music community.



&nbsp;



We coordinate SSDP &amp; DanceSafe chapters to promote for partnered artists and festivals in exchange for table space to:

<ol>

	<li>Increase awareness of the negative impact of our nations failed “War on Drugs” &amp; encourage involvement in the political process to effect change</li>

	<li>Recruit new volunteers and promote specific local/state/national drug policy reform initiatives &amp; campaigns</li>

	<li>Spread factual drug info, Know-Your-Rights materials and other harm reduction supplies plus create a safe space for people to discuss substance use</li>

	<li>Conduct merchandise contests &amp; raffles in cooperation with artists for fundraising</li>

	<li>Distribute info about other drug policy reform organizations such as <a href="http://www.maps.org/">MAPS</a>, <a href="http://www.leap.cc">LEAP</a>, <a href="http://safeaccessnow.org/">ASA</a>, <a href="http://www.drugpolicy.org/">DPA</a>, <a href="http://ww.mpp.org">MPP</a> &amp; <a href="http://www.norml.org">NORML</a></li>

</ol>

In addition, our partnered artists also help us by promoting significant SSDP campaigns/initiatives &amp; media blasts, conducting interviews with us discussing their thoughts on youth activism and the failed &#8220;War on Drugs” plus giving shout-outs at shows and through social media.

In 2012, after a partnership forged with <a href="http://dancesafe.org/">DanceSafe</a> at SSDP’s National Conference in Denver, we expanded our work into providing harm reduction services for festivals and events. In the Summer our volunteers set up booths at countless events such as <a href="http://summercampfestival.com/">Summer Camp Music Festival</a>, <a href="http://rootwirefestival.com/en.html">Rootwire Music &amp; Arts Festival</a>, <a href="https://www.desertrocks.org/">Desert Rocks</a> and others distributing our newly created <a href="http://issuu.com/the_amplify_project/docs/amplify_festival_safety_guide?mode=window&amp;pageNumber=1">Festival Safety Guide</a>, free water, factual drug info, ear plugs, condoms, 5-HTP, Himalayan Rock Salt and other supplies to keep festival attendee&#8217;s safe &amp; informed. At several we also worked with on-site medical staff to provide &#8220;Cool-Down&#8221; areas, assist in crisis intervention and provide psychedelic emergency counseling all to prevent unnecessary off-site medical transports with great success.



<a href="/assets/2013/01/402868_10151124682417661_844084950_n.jpg"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-6637" alt="402868_10151124682417661_844084950_n" src="http://ssdp.org/assets/2013/01/402868_10151124682417661_844084950_n-300x225.jpg" width="300" height="225" /></a>



After an incredible year of growth for the Project seeing:

<ul>

	<li>Major artists added including Umphrey&#8217;s McGee, Big Gigantic &amp; EOTO and more</li>

	<li>More than 40+ small to major concerts tabled at by local SSDP chapters with an estimated reach of well over 20,000</li>

	<li>7 Regional Organizers recruited &amp; trained in CO, FL, OR, VA, SC &amp; PA</li>

	<li>Booths set up at 3 major music festivals with combined attendance of over 25,000 people</li>

	<li>Plus the beginning on a new ongoing artist interview series</li>

</ul>

We definitely have NO plans of slowing down anytime soon!



<a href="/assets/2013/01/259194_456321701101564_89480727_o.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-6638 alignleft" alt="259194_456321701101564_89480727_o" src="http://ssdp.org/assets/2013/01/259194_456321701101564_89480727_o-300x200.jpg" width="300" height="200" /></a>



Below for your convenience we have compiled ALL of our partner artists Winter/Spring ‘13 tour dates we have been guaranteed table space. If interested in volunteering to help spread our important message to the live music community please review the list carefully and identify ANY shows in your area. Once identified, send us an email at amplify@ssdp.org to request promo materials &amp; secure you or your SSDP/DanceSafe chapter a spot at the show.



The list is quite substantial so <strong>please</strong> take your time and review all dates, even if you do not know or are not a fan of a particular artist. One of the greatest things about AMPLIFY is getting to experience new, often unfamiliar music, for FREE with friends and fellow chapter members while spreading a message we all love &amp; believe in. You don’t want to let musical tastes get in the way of utilizing this amazingly unique promotional, outreach, fundraising, team-building and educational tool all-in-one to its fullest potential.
