Parents of a student in the Delaware Valley School District have <a href="http://www.strausnews.com/articles/2010/08/27/pike_county_courier/news/3.txt">threatened a law suit over the student drug testing policy</a> that requires all students to be tested if they want to participate in sports, extra curricular activities or have campus parking permits. The student in question wanted to be part of the scrap-booking club and her parents asked that she be exempt from the testing.
<blockquote>Parent Kathy Kiederer, who has debated privacy issues with the board before, was there following her letter asking that her daughter be exempted from drug testing to take part in a scrap-booking club. “I’ve written to ask an exemption and you haven’t changed the guidelines,” she said.</blockquote>
