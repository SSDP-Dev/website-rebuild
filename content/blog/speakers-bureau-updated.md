I am thrilled to announce a stellar new group of individuals recently added to <a href="www.ssdp.org/resources/speakers/speakers-bureau">SSDP’s Speakers Bureau</a>. We’ve added over a dozen new speakers to our already impressive list, with even more to join shortly. SSDP students and staff alike are incredibly grateful that so many amazing activists and movement leaders are willing to engage with our students on the campus level.

Our new speakers include authors, lobbyists, activists, lawyers, and SSDP alumni, all of whom are dedicating their work to reveal the inherent flaws in the drug policies of the federal government.

Many of our new speakers currently hold high positions with some of SSDP’s allied organizations such as: The <a href="www.drugpolicy.org">Drug Policy Alliance</a> (DPA), <a href="norml.org">National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws</a> (NORML), and <a href="www.mpp.org">Marijuana Policy Project</a> (MPP). Others come from less drug-policy-oriented organizations, such as <a href="www.flexyourrights.org/‎">Flex Your Rights</a> and <a href="studentsforliberty.org/">Students for Liberty</a>.

They join our already-established Speakers Bureau group which includes members from such organizations as: <a href="www.marijuanamajority.com">Marijuana Majority</a>, <a href="www.cjpf.org">The Criminal Justice Policy Foundation</a> (CJPF), and <a href="safeaccessnow.org/‎">Americans for Safe Access</a> (ASA).  This already great tool will only become more effective for students looking to host a speaker on their campus next semester.

I encourage any student who is interested in having one of these drug policy reform champions speak on their campus to check out the updated <a href="www.ssdp.org/resources/speakers/speakers-bureau">Speakers Bureau</a> page.
