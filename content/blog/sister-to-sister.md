Last week, Aaron Houston and I represented SSDP at the <a href="http://norml.org/index.cfm?Group_ID=8461">40th Anniversary NORML Conference </a>in Denver, CO. Aaron spoke on Thursday&#8217;s panel, &#8220;The Feds, Marijuana and You&#8221; (<a href="http://www.stickam.com/viewMedia.do?mId=191308494&amp;pId=22233">watch the video here</a>)<strong><em>.</em></strong>

On Friday, I had the pleasure of joining 4 incredibly inspiring women reformers on the&#8221;Closing the Cannabis Gender Gap&#8221; panel (<a href="http://www.stickam.com/viewMedia.do?mId=191314363&amp;pId=22233">full video here</a>, I&#8217;m the last speaker beginning ~45:00) <a href="http://ssdp.org/resources/presentations/norml2011">See the slides from our presentation on our website.</a> It was there that we announced the launch of an exciting new project that SSDP is proud to be working on with the <a href="http://norml.org/women">NORML Women&#8217;s Alliance</a>.

The purpose and goals for <a href="http://ssdp.org/resources/sistertosister">&#8220;Sister-to-Sister&#8221; Cultivating Female Activists Mentoring Project</a> are as follows:
<ul>
	<li>To connect women in the marijuana movement with each other in order to facilitate a close-knit community of female drug law reform advocates.</li>
	<li>To make women feel welcomed as part of the larger reform movement by connecting those who have been involved for less than 2-3 years with those who have been involved for more than 2-3 years.</li>
	<li>To build strong professional and personal relationships between women of all demographics who wouldn’t have otherwise been introduced to one another.</li>
	<li>To share skills, information, resources, contacts, and other useful knowledge that will help female reformers be more engaged and more effective as they work toward common interests.</li>
	<li>To empower and instill confidence in women who are interested in seeking leadership positions within their respective groups and organizations.</li>
	<li>To help close the gender gap that currently exists within the marijuana law reform community.</li>
</ul>
