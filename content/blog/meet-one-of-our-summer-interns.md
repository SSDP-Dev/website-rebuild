Working at Students for Sensible Drug Policy has been a dream of mine ever since I found out about the organization. I was introduced to SSDP by <a href="http://ssdp.org/about/staff/board-of-directors/brandon-levey">Brandon Levey</a>, current Vice Chair of the SSDP Board of Directors, almost as soon as I arrived at <a href="http://ssdp.org/chapters/midatlantic/maryland/university-of-maryland">University of Maryland</a>. One morning he called me and said I should come by Stamp (our Student Union) because his organization was tabling there, and it supported legalizing marijuana. That was all I needed to hear, and I biked to Stamp as fast as I could. I quickly learned what SSDP was all about, and began attending meetings. I was so impressed by all the people who were running the chapter, and knew it was something I wanted to be a part of. In sophomore year I became the Secretary of our UMD SSDP chapter, in junior year I was Vice President of NORML, and in senior year I am reclaiming my position as Secretary of SSDP. It&#8217;s going to rock!



<img class="alignleft" src="http://ssdp.org/assets/images/blog/2012/May/hemp-protein.jpg" alt="" width="135" height="141" />I am especially passionate about medicinal cannabis and hemp seed nutrition, and one of the reasons I absolutely despise the drug war is because of how much it raises the price of hemp seed products. As a vegetarian with veganistic tendencies, I get most of my protein from hemp protein powder (straight from the jar, baby!), and that gets expensive since all raw hemp products must be imported from Canada and abroad. This attack on our diets is just one way the Drug War harms everyone in society, and it must be ended so everyone can live better.
