Students for Sensible Drug Policy is pleased to announce that we are currently accepting applications for several internship positions here in our Washington, DC office. We are very excited to begin the application process, and anticipate a competitive pool of applicants.



<strong>Positions we are looking to fill include: outreach, policy, journalism, and web/graphic design. Specific duties, qualifications, and more information are listed on our <a href="http://ssdp.org/about/job-opportunities/internships-and-fellowships/">Internships and Fellowships page</a>.</strong>



From my brief experience as a summer intern these past couple months, I can tell you that this is not an opportunity you want to miss out on. The office is nice and cozy (okay, it&#8217;s smaller than a typical DC apartment) which leads to the development of some meaningful and close relationships with your fellow staffers. The office neighbors are friendly, you&#8217;ll work in a historical building a couple blocks from the White House, and you&#8217;ll have by far the coolest bosses out of all your other DC intern peers.



The two months I&#8217;ve been here have absolutely flown by; it didn&#8217;t even feel like work, despite the large amounts of projects and tasks I was able to contribute to. From the smaller duties of writing several blog posts with creative license to helping organize and manage our hugely successful <a href="http://ssdp.org/news/blog/announcing-ssdps-federal-marijuana-lobby-day/">Federal Marijuana Lobby Day</a>, and the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">long</span> list of tasks in between, I truly feel like I&#8217;ve accomplished more than I was expecting to before starting as an intern at a non-profit.



I could go on about my experiences at this lovely office, but suffice to say that it was a blast. I couldn&#8217;t recommend enough that you apply <a href="http://ssdp.org/about/job-opportunities/internships-and-fellowships/">TODAY</a>!
