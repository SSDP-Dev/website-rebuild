As the spring semester draws to a close, many students will be graduating and moving on from school to the next chapter of their lives.

Being a member of an SSDP chapter is a defining part of many students’ college experiences; I know it certainly was for me! The <a href="http://ssdp.org/alumni">SSDP Alumni Association</a> aims to provide a framework for SSDPers to continue developing as leaders and professionals, advocating for an end to the drug war, and staying connected to their peers who share that passion after leaving school.

<strong>Today SSDP is kicking off our fourth annual Alumni Association Membership Drive!</strong> Each day this week, we’ll feature a blog post written by an alum on a variety of topics.

The purpose of this membership drive is, of course, to invite SSDP alumni to join the <a href="http://ssdp.org/alumni">Alumni Association</a>, and it’s our goal to add 20 new members before Friday. It’s also an opportunity to reflect on your time as an undergrad in SSDP, share your favorite memories, and reconnect with the SSDP network.
<h1>PRIZES</h1>
To make things a bit more interesting, everyone who completes enrollment in the Alumni Association before 11:59pm EST this Friday, May 18th will be <strong>entered to win one free registration </strong>to <a href="http://conference.ssdp.org">SSDP2019: The Annual Students for Sensible Drug Policy Conference</a> taking place in the Chicago area March 29-31, 2019 OR a <strong>$50 Amazon gift card</strong>.

AND the alum who refers the most new members this week <strong>will also receive a free conference registration </strong>OR a<strong> $50 Amazon gift card</strong>. So, be sure to remind those you invite to mention your name in the “referred by” field!
