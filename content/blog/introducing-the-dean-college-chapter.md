I&#8217;m thrilled to introduce our newest established SSDP chapter in Massachusetts, Dean College! Chapter leader Liam Devine has been working to set up the chapter for about a year now and finally got things up and running this semester. I spoke with Liam about his progress thus far and what we can expect from Dean College SSDP moving forward:
<div><b>How did you hear about SSDP?</b></div>
<div>About this time last year, I was looking for a way to break into the cannabis industry and about every website I read told me that getting involved with SSDP was the way to go.</div>
<div></div>
<div><b>Why did you want to get involved/what made you decide to start a chapter?</b></div>
<div>Honestly, I was sick and tired of all the misinformation out there and being told my opinions were not valid because of my age. I knew that SSDP was the way to help correct misinformation and starting a chapter at dean would help empower me and my peers.</div>
<div></div>
<div><b>What has the reception been like on campus? From students, teachers, administration, etc.</b></div>
<div>Pretty good. Getting started was a little slow but we had our first meeting last week and had about 25 attendees.</div>
<div></div>
<div>

<div id="attachment_21150" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><a href="/assets/Screen-Shot-2017-02-28-at-2.10.10-PM.png"><img class="wp-image-21150 size-medium" src="https://ssdp.org/assets/Screen-Shot-2017-02-28-at-2.10.10-PM-300x226.png" width="300" height="226" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Dean College SSDP at a recent meeting.</p></div>

<b>What are some of the things you have planned or want to plan for next semester?</b>

</div>
<div>Besides administrative things, we already are part of Decades Night here at Dean and we will be hosting the 60s. We plan to have some sort of interactive Drug education as well as protest education; maybe even help people make signs. Other than that, we want to some sort of community service project and a big goal of ours is to have Narcan on campus.</div>
<div></div>
<div><b>What is the most challenging part of your experience starting/running the chapter so far?</b></div>
<div>All the red tape at Dean definitely slowed our process way down. Trying to find a time that works for everyone is also difficult.</div>
<div></div>
<div><b>What is the most rewarding part?</b></div>
<div>Having honest conversations during our meetings is great. People actually contribute and are learning that this is a safe space for everyone to share their thoughts.</div>
<div></div>
<div><b>What are you most excited about for your chapter/school/state/region/ss<wbr />dp/drug policy right now?</b></div>
<div>To really make effective change on campus.</div>
<div></div>
<div><b>What is your vision for Dean College? Where do you see your chapter in a year? in 4 or 5 years?</b></div>
<div>Hopefully helping to create state laws that make sense and being an active, known part of the Dean Community.</div>
