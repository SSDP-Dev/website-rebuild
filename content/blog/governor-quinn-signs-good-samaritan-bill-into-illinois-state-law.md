FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE



Springfield, IL – Yesterday, February 6th, Governor Quinn signed <a href="http://www.ilga.gov/legislation/BillStatus.asp?DocNum=1701&amp;GAID=11&amp;DocTypeID=SB&amp;SessionID=84&amp;GA=97">SB 1701</a> (known better as the Good Samaritan Policy or Overdose Immunity Bill), which has been on his desk since December 16th, marking the first time any policy of this sort has passed into law in Illinois.  In layman’s terms, it establishes extended rights for drug offenders calling on behalf of someone overdosing.  In a state where heroin overdose is among the worst in the nation, this bill was designed to try and reduce the harms of substances regulated by the Controlled Substances Act.



More specifically, this act provides limited exoneration of violations of the Controlled Substances Act when calling on behalf of someone in need of emergency medical help. Illinois joins Connecticut, New York, New Mexico, and Washington as the fifth state to enact such a law.



“It’s great to know that our elected leaders have listened to the harm reduction ideals we have lobbied for and established that reforming our drug policies will have a positive impact on our future” said Jeremy Orbach, Founder of the Students for Sensible Drug Policy chapter at <a href="http://ssdp.org/chapters/midwest/illinois/northern-illinois-university">Northern Illinois University</a>.



The passing of this bill fits directly in the mission of Students for Sensible Drug Policy, stating that SSDP works to reduce the harms of drug abuse on society, and should prove to save lives.  Hopefully this is the first among many of many bills that will actually reduce the harms of drug abuse on society.

Students for Sensible Drug Policy is an international grassroots network of students who educate their peers, parents, and policymakers about how the drug war has failed our generation and our society.



<em>SSDP mobilizes and empowers young people to participate in the political process, pushing for sensible policies to achieve a safer and more just future, while fighting back against counterproductive drug war policies, particularly those that directly harm students and youth.</em>
