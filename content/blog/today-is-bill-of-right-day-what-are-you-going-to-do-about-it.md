Friends,



This morning as I was reading the newspapers thoroughly, as I usually do, <strong>the only mention that today is the 220<sup>th</sup> anniversary of the ratification of our Bill of Rights</strong>, the first ten amendments to the U.S. Constitution, were <strong>large advertisements by the Cato Institute</strong>. To check out the Cato ad, go here: <a href="http://www.cato.org/us-constitution/" target="_blank">http://www.cato.org/us-constitution/</a>



My congratulations to Cato for honoring what so desperately needs to be honored in this time of widespread governmental abuse of power. This is a celebration that is more important than most of our formal holidays. There are no special sales at the mall, no big discounts provided by Internet retailers.



If you are a citizen who treasures his or her liberty, marking the adoption of the Bill of Rights is an historical event we should commemorate. (There would be no academic freedom, no religious freedom, no Internet as we know it, no libraries as we know them, no movies or music was we know them, no Occupy movement, no environmental movement, if there were no Bill of Rights!)



<strong>Today is a great day to <a href="http://www.ssdp.org/donate">make a small contribution to SSDP</a> in celebration of the Bill of Rights.</strong>



The Bill of Rights is not self-executing! To retain its vitality requires the political struggle of those who value its protections.



<strong>SSDP is one organization, in working to curb the infringements on liberty of the war on drugs, that deserves our support on this day.</strong>



My friend Tim Lynch at Cato sent this message which I am forwarding, and I urge you to forward it to your friends:

<blockquote>To mark Bill of Rights Day, the Cato Institute is running an ad in several newspapers to (a) consider the condition of our constitutional safeguards and (b) remind our fellow citizens of their responsibility to be vigilant against government overreaching.  One of my goals this morning is to have this information &#8220;go viral&#8221; across the internet &#8230; so kindly do your part and forward this along to people you know and ask them to do the same.  After all, it <em>is</em> Bill of Rights Day.</blockquote>

For a related blog post that supports the claims made in the ad, <a href="http://www.cato-at-liberty.org/today-is-bill-of-rights-day/">go here</a>.



Cato was also invited to submit testimony this week on a bill that would reform the federal criminal code. For more information about that, <a href="http://judiciary.house.gov/hearings/hear_12132011.html">go here</a>.
