That&#8217;s right! We have a chance to change one of the most destructive drug policies ever created. The HEA Aid Elimination Penalty has denied financial aid for college to more than 200,000 students with drug convictions. However, the 2009 SAFRA would make it so that this law would only apply to those convicted of selling drugs. Considering that nearly 90% of marijuana arrests are for possession only &#8211; this is a huge victory! Sadly, Rep. Mark &#8220;sneaky snake&#8221; Souder (R-IN), who created the penalty in 1998, has introduced an amendment to strike out that reform. But <a href="http://www.ssdp.org/urgent">we can stop it</a>.

Here is what you need to do:

1) MAKE THE CALL: Dial the Capitol Switchboard at (202) 224-3121. Ask for your representative&#8217;s office if you know his/her name. If you don&#8217;t, simply give the operator your address. (Please be patient for an answer, as it sometimes takes several rings to get through. And be sure to leave a voice message if the staff is out for the day.)

2) SPEAK YOUR MIND: When the receptionist in your representative’s office answers the phone, politely say: “My name is ________ and I’d like my representative to vote against Representative Souder&#8217;s Amendment to the Student Aid and Fiscal Responsibility Act, which denies educational opportunities to students with minor drug possession convictions. Blocking access to education causes more drug problems and hurts the economy. Thank you.”

3) SPREAD THE WORD: Forward this message to everyone you know! CLICK HERE TO SHARE ON FACEBOOK. Twitter this URL: http://ssdp.org/urgent

This is so easy folks. Anyone can do it. Don&#8217;t believe me? Watch me do it!
