<p>Green Lion Partners invites you to join us and <a href="http://ssdp.org">Students for Sensible Drug Policy</a> at a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.eventbrite.com/e/ssdps-sensible-celebration-tickets-34515646227"><span>Sensible Celebration</span></a> in Oakland on Monday, June 12.&nbsp;<span id="docs-internal-guid-f098dfce-7919-04d3-4bfd-4251b707d33f"><a href="https://www.greenlionpartners.com/">Green Lion Partners</a> is a business strategy firm focused on early stage development in the cannabis industry. We operate Dipstick Vapes, LeafList, and Natural Order Supply and invest in and advise a variety of other cannabis companies driven by our mission to improve public perception of cannabis &#8212; and that&#8217;s where SSDP comes in.</span><br /></span><br />We support SSDP because young people are indispensable in the fight to end prohibition. The War on Drugs is waged in the name of young people, but too often our voices are absent from conversations about drug policy. SSDP&#8217;s members are using their voices to push back: they made 70,000 phone calls to voters in states that voted to legalize cannabis last year, and they&#8217;re speaking to their school administrators, elected officials, and to their peers about ending prohibitionist drug policies that do more harm than good. And they&#8217;re really, really good at it.<br /><br />If you&#8217;re part of the cannabis industry, believe in ending the devastating War on Drugs, or simply think it&#8217;s neat that SSDP builds students into leaders, join us in supporting SSDP by coming to the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.eventbrite.com/e/ssdps-sensible-celebration-tickets-34515646227">Sensible Celebration</a>. If you&#8217;ve been to an SSDP party before, you already know it&#8217;s well worth the ticket price to meet the amazing people who are drawn in by SSDP&#8217;s values while supporting a great cause. If you can&#8217;t make it to the party, <a href="https://ssdp.org/sensible-society/">join the Sensible Society</a> or <a href="https://ssdp.nationbuilder.com/donate">make a one-time donation</a>.&nbsp;</p>
