On Wednesday, September 23rd, we were very happy to co-sponsor a Reddit AMA with <a href="http://leap.cc" target="_blank">Law Enforcement Against Prohibition</a> (LEAP), featuring former Baltimore Police Officer, <a href="http://michaelawoodjr.net/about-me" target="_blank">Michael Wood, Jr.</a>

Michael answered questions about his experience as a whistleblower on the Baltimore Police department and how the drug war has perpetuated conflict between communities and police.

Below, you&#8217;ll find some of his answers that were particularly powerful.
