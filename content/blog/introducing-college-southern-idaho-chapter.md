We&#8217;re expanding our presence in Idaho, and I&#8217;m so excited to announce our newest chapter at the College of Southern Idaho. I asked chapter leader Skyler Rienstra to share some of their journey, ideas, and passion on the SSDP blog. Check it out!

<strong>How did you hear about SSDP?</strong><strong> </strong>

I heard about SSDP through an article written by Andrew Sewell &#8220;So You Want to be a Psychedelic Researcher&#8221;.  I found the article, in general, to be extremely helpful and I was absolutely thrilled to know that SSDP was even a thing!

<strong>Why did you want to get involved/what made you decide to start a chapter?</strong>

The primary reason for wanting to bring this club to my campus is because I love my community.  I think that our current drug policies are an absolute sham.  The potential positive and therapeutic benefits of sacred visionary plants (when used in a responsible manner) are very well documented.  When we control for the set and setting, these substances appear to facilitate very positive and life-transforming experiences.  And of course, the traditional use of plants as medicines for communing with the Earth is as old as time.

<strong>What has the reception been like on campus? From students, teachers, administration, etc.</strong>

The reception on campus has been much better than I expected.  The student body senate was unanimous in their vote to officially approve the club on campus.  As Terence Mckenna says &#8220;If the truth can be told so as to be understood, it will be believed&#8221;.  I thoroughly enjoy my discussions with the psychology, biology, anthropology, humanities, etc professors about the nature of psychedelics and their impact on human evolution.

<strong>What are some of the things you have planned or want to plan for next semester?</strong>

For next semester, I would love to get a good speaker on campus.  Or two or three or five hundred.  I think that there is still so much discussion that needs to happen within the Twin Falls community.  I am hoping that we can start organizing and implementing peer education and harm-reduction on campus.

<strong>What is the most challenging part of your experience starting/running the chapter so far?</strong><strong> </strong>

I&#8217;m a very open, yet low conscientious individual and sometimes it can be difficult in general to organize events and things like that.  Fortunately, I surround myself with those who can make up for my shortcomings and I am deeply grateful for their being.  I think that in general, the war on drugs, substance misuse, and abuse, addiction, etc are very complex issues and the topics require a lot of thinking and mulling over.  I think that compassion and love for the fellow individual are good compasses for navigating such deep waters.

<strong>What is the most rewarding part?</strong>

I think that the most rewarding part has been connecting with others.  I think that when we put our best minds and hearts together, we can unleash unimaginable good.  Taking on the responsibility of implementing a club such as this in my community has been deeply meaningful.  It has given me hope; hope for the redemption of the human spirit

<strong>What are you most excited about for your chapter/school/state/region/ss<wbr />dp/drug policy right now?</strong>

I&#8217;m most excited to attend the SSDP international conference in about 2 weeks!  I can&#8217;t wait to meet other students across the globe who are seeking to reform our drug policies.  I think that big things will happen!

<strong>What is your vision for CSI SSDP? Where do you see your chapter in a year? in 4 or 5 years?</strong>

I am hoping that in the future CSI SSDP will be a force for good in the Twin Falls community and the rest of Idaho.  I hope that it can serve as a valuable and reliable source of information and education.  I hope that the club will inspire students to endeavor to understand the complex and intricate landscape that surrounds us.  We can make a difference.  We can break the cyclical chains of ignorance, greed, and ill-will and replace them with wisdom, generosity, and compassion.
