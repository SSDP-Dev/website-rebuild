Today was a bit of a bust. There were only two training sessions, followed by a parade of all the &#8220;pimped out&#8221; D.A.R.E. vehicles seized via asset forfeiture laws, a motorcycle stunt show, and an opening reception with mariachi music and fajitas. (Okay, so it was kind of fun.)

I did get a lot of great video footage today, but nothing too juicy to blog about yet. Tomorrow is when the conference really gets going, so there will be much more to report on then.

Also, I found out that the Drug War celebs who I thought were speaking (Gonzales, Hatch, &amp; Walters) are going to be no-shows. The video I posted earlier indicated that they&#8217;d be here, but they are nowhere in the program materials. Bummer.

Tomorrow, I&#8217;m attending the following two workshops:
<ul>
	<li>Drug Trends in America: Raves, Ecstasy, Club Drugs and Inhalants</li>
	<li>How the Media is Affecting Our Kids</li>
</ul>
The latter workshop is four hours (good grief!) but should be pretty entertaining.

Over and out.
