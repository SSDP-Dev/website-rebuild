It&#8217;s about that time of year when lots of students are wrapping up their college years, but that certainly doesn&#8217;t mean an end to their time as an advocate for drug policy reform. The SSDP alumni network is a vast and robust network of former student drug policy activists who work in a great variety of different industries with advice and connections to share with their fellow SSDPers.



Here are seven ways to stay involved with Students for Sensible Drug Policy after graduation:

<ul>

	<li>Join the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/ssdpalum">SSDP alumni network Facebook group</a></li>

	<li>Join the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/344729335623349/">SSDP jobs and opportunities Facebook group</a></li>

	<li>Apply to join<a href="http://ssdp.org/resources/speakers/join-ssdps-speakers-bureau/"> SSDP&#8217;s Speakers Bureau</a></li>

	<li>Add your position to the <a href="http://ssdp.org/alumni/where-our-alumni-work/">list of where our alumni work</a></li>

	<li>Stay in touch with your <a href="http://ssdp.org/chapters/">chapter or chapters nearby</a></li>

	<li><a href="http://ssdp.org/events/">Attend an SSDP event</a> (such as our Federal Marijuana Lobby Day, West Coast Camping Trip, and East Coast Camping Trip all happening this summer!)</li>

	<li>Become a <a href="http://ssdp.org/become-a-member/">Sensible Member</a></li>

</ul>

Can you think of any other ways for non-students to stay involved?  Let us know in the comments or <a href="mailto:stacia@ssdp.org">shoot us an email</a>.



Congrats grads!
