Hey everyone, join me in welcoming Salt Lake Community College to the family! The chapter founder and president, Garret Rueckert, took some time to sit down with me and answer some questions about his aspirations for the chapter.

<strong>How did you hear about SSDP?</strong>
I looked into SSDP on my own after learning about the War on Drugs in one of my classes. I was
concerned enough about it to reach out on my own accord. Still hoping to help improve a big
problem in our country!

<strong>Why did you want to get involved/what made you decide to start a chapter?</strong>
The War on Drugs has never made any sense to me. It affects our liberty, is ineffective, and is a
colossal waste of money.

<strong>What has the reception been like on campus? From students, teachers, administration, etc.</strong>
We are still a very small fledgling chapter, and haven&#8217;t made any waves yet!

<strong>What are some of the things you have planned or want to plan for next semester?</strong>
Definitely try to schedule a debate with Utah lawmakers who have opposed medical marijuana measures in our state legislature. How possible that will be remains to be seen.

<strong>What is the most challenging part of your experience starting/running the chapter so far?</strong>
Finding a way to meet up at a commuter community college. Nobody lives on campus!

<strong>What is the most rewarding part?</strong>
Feeling like I can one day make a difference in Utah.

<strong>What are you most excited about for your chapter/school/state/region/</strong>ssdp<strong>/drug policy right now?</strong>
Excited to actually put in some footwork for the chapter!

<strong>What is your vision for your chapter? Where do you see your chapter in a year? in 4 or 5 years?</strong>
As just a two-year college, I hope to pass on the chapter to someone who will do the same when they graduate!
