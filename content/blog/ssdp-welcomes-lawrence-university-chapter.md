SSDP&#8217;s chapter network grew this week with an addition at Lawrence University in Appelton, Wisconsin. I got the chance to catch up with chapter founder, Evan Johnson, about his work to start a new chapter. Here is what he had to say about his involvement with SSDP so far.

<strong>Name:</strong> Evan Johnson



<strong>School:</strong> Lawrence



<strong>University Major:</strong> Government/ Russian Studies



<strong>Chapter Position: </strong>President and Founder

<strong>SSDP: How did you hear about SSDP? </strong>



<strong>Evan:</strong> I actually discovered SSDP through StumbleUpon, and my interest was piqued as I learned more about how to be active in things I believe in.



<strong>SSDP: Why did you want to get involved/what made you decide to start a chapter?</strong>



<strong>Evan:</strong> I thought that there are a lot of university policies and local laws that weren&#8217;t rational and I felt like they were influenced by biases instead of facts- for example, our school has recently put up anti-marijuana posters with inflated statistics.



<strong>SSDP: What has the reception been like on campus? From students, teachers, administration, etc.</strong>



<strong>Evan:</strong> Student reception has been the best, with a good amount of sympathy and several ideas.  Teachers haven&#8217;t been unfriendly but are hesitant to openly support the group, while the administration has recognized us as an official organization.

<strong>SSDP: What are some of the things you have planned or want to plan for the spring semester?</strong>



<strong>Evan:</strong> A screening of the documentary &#8220;The Union&#8221; and a discussion sessions with the producer, bringing in an anti-prohibition speaker, and hosting a campus forum.

<strong>SSDP: What is the most challenging part of your experience starting/running the chapter so far?</strong>



<strong>Evan:</strong> Getting people to consistently show up to meetings.

<strong>SSDP: What is the most rewarding part?</strong>



<strong>Evan:</strong> Being able to schedule events and educate.

<strong>SSDP: What are you most excited about for your chapter/school/state/region/ssdp/drug policy right now? </strong>



<strong>Evan:</strong> Educating the campus and busting myths.

<strong>SSDP: What is your vision for SSDP? Where do you see your chapter in a year? in 4 or 5 years?</strong>



<strong>Evan: </strong>I see the Lawrence chapter of SSDP growing and becoming more involved in the campus life as an educational force.
