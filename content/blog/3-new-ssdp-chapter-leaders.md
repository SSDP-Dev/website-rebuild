Announcing the latest additions to SSDP&#8217;s chapter network; we&#8217;re proud to add the following three new chapters to <a href="http://ssdp.org/chapters">the map</a>!

<ul>

	<li><a href="http://ssdp.org/chapters/southern/florida/daytona">Daytona State College</a> &#8211; Daytona Beach, FL (<a href="http://ssdp.org/chapters/southern">Southern Region</a>)

When Patrick Moo called our office for the first time at the beginning of December, he was already ahead of the game. He was already in the process of starting a chapter at Daytona, had recruited several interested students and had gained the support of a faculty member! The chapter has already begun collecting petitions to get medical marijuana on the Florida ballot in 2012.</li>

</ul>

	<li><a href="http://ssdp.org/chapters/northeast/new-jersey/rowan">Rowan University</a> &#8211; Glassboro, NJ (<a href="http://www.ssdp.org/chapters/northeast">Northeast Region</a>)

Phil Simmons discovered us when he was calling California voters to support Proposition 19 using<a href="http://www.justsaynow.com/"> Just Say Now</a>&#8216;s phonebank tool, and decided to establish a chapter at Rowan. In an effort to begin building coalitions on campus, he has reached out to several other school clubs who are willing to give the chapter a few minutes to speak about SSDP at the beginning of their meetings. Now that they&#8217;ve gained official recognition this week, Rowan SSDP has hit the ground running and have several events and campaigns lined up for the semester.</li>

</ul>

	<li><a href="http://ssdp.org/chapters/midatlantic/virginia/radford">Radford University</a> &#8211; Radford, VA (<a href="http://www.ssdp.org/chapters/midatlantic">Mid-Atlantic Region</a>)

Dave Campanella informally stumbled across an SSDP chapter about a year ago at <a href="http://ssdp.org/chapters/midatlantic/west-virginia/wvu">West Virginia University</a>where he was an undergraduate. Last fall he begun his time at Radford pursuing a masters degree in criminal justice, and is writing his thesis on drug policy issues. Andrew Fernandez heard about SSDP from his brother who currently leads our <a href="http://www.ssdp.org/chapters/midatlantic/virginia/george-mason-university">George Mason University chapter</a>! As a former RA on campus, he knows that Radford is one of those &#8220;call the cops when you smell the tinest amount of marijuana&#8221; type of schools, so the chapter will be <a href="http://www.ssdp.org/campaigns/campus-change-campaign">bringing attention to the issue</a>.</li>
