Impressively, Chris has formed not one, but two SSDP chapters that are both currently active in Colorado. First, he organized students at Front Range Community College in Longmont. Under his leadership, <a href="http://longmontledger.com/news/student-group-lobbies-for-changes-to-drug-laws/">the FRCC chapter</a> worked on numerous campaigns and helped spread SSDP throughout the state. Before transferring to the University of Northern Colorado, Chris ensured that leadership was successfully passed on to Nick Davies (who earned himself <a href="http://daregeneration.blogspot.com/2010/12/chapter-leader-of-week-nicholas-davies.html">Chapter Leader of the Week</a> back in December 2010).

At UNCO, Chris quickly formed a <a href="http://ssdp.org/chapters/mountain-plains/colorado/unco">new chapter of SSDP</a>, and recruited other enthusiastic activists to help spread the message. He&#8217;s currently campaigning for Director of University Relations position in the UNCO student senate.

In addition to all this, Chris now volunteers as SSDP&#8217;s Colorado State Coordinator, helping to increase communication among established chapters in the state and also proactively seeking students to form new chapters.
