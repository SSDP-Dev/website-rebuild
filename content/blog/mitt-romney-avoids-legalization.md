This semester I had the opportunity to intern with <a href="http://www.granitestaters.com/">Granite Staters for Medical Marijuana</a> in New Hampshire. GSMM followed NH presidential candidates and put on the pressure about medical marijuana. Mainly we wanted to know what candidates were willing to end the raids on medical marijuana patients in the 12 states that have passed legislation protecting patients and their doctors.

<a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/22100708/page/3/">National Journal</a> did a story called Tales from NH Town Halls and reported the details of NH town hall events where the candidates had campaigned. In a section of the story titled Adventures with Advocacy Groups, the story discusses the activists that follow the candidates and promote their issues. They wrote about GSMM even including a transcript of my McCain encounter.

[Of all the NH advocacy groups] None has been more persistent than the members of the Granite Staters for Medical Marijuana, pushing to legalize the drug.

Clayton Holton, seen in this video depicting the ignorance of Mitt Romney and Rudy Guliani in particular, suffers from Muscular Dystrophy. Clayton is only 22 years old and is the youngest man ever admitted to a NH nursing home. That is where he currently lives, unable to use marijuana to control his pain, nausea, or stimulate his appetite but provided a steady regiment of Oxycontin, a drug he wishes could be replaced with marijuana.

Check out over 40 video encounters with presidential candidates by GSMM at <a href="http://www.youtube.com/livefreenh">youtube</a>. Unfortunately the GSMM campaign is over but I plan on posting some of the highlights here on DARE Generation. GSMM was probably the most successful marijuana campaign in NH to date and Clayton Holton will surely be NH&#8217;s face for medical marijuana in the Granite State.
