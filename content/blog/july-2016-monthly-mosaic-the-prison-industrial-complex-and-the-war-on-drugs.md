<span style="font-weight: 400">The Prison Industrial Complex and the War on Drugs</span>

<hr />

<a href="http://ssdp.org/"><span style="font-weight: 400">Students for Sensible Drug Policy</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">’s original motto was “Schools Not Prisons,” in response to the “</span><a href="http://www.raiseyourvoice.com/Backgrounder.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400">Aid Elimination Penalty</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">,” an amendment added to the </span><a href="http://www.tgslc.org/policy/hea.cfm"><span style="font-weight: 400">Higher Education Act</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> in 1998, which excluded students with drug convictions from receiving federal financial aid to attend institutions of higher learning.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">In early 2006,</span> <a href="http://ssdp.org/campaigns/the-higher-education-act/"><span style="font-weight: 400">SSDP and our allies forced Congress to scale back the law</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">, allowing people who got convicted before they decided to go to college to move on with their lives and earn an education</span><span style="font-weight: 400">.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">Then, during the Higher Education Act Reauthorization process of 2008, </span><a href="http://ssdp.org/campaigns/the-higher-education-act/"><span style="font-weight: 400">Congress further scaled back the penalty</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">, making it easier for students with drug convictions to regain eligibility for financial aid. However</span><span style="font-weight: 400">, </span><a href="http://ssdp.org/campaigns/the-higher-education-act/"><span style="font-weight: 400">college students who get convicted still lose financial aid, meaning many of them are forced to leave school</span></a> <span style="font-weight: 400">temporarily, if not permanently. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">SSDP strongly believes that when young people are  struggling with problematic drug use, taking them out of school and putting them in prison not only denies them real  treatment, but is a serious human rights violation. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">While the drug war is starting to show signs of ending, the War on Drugs remains one of the policies most responsible for feeding the prison industrial complex. </span><a href="http://www.drugwarfacts.org/cms/Prisons_and_Drugs#sthash.iQ2Geyet.dpbs"><span style="font-weight: 400">As of 2014, 50% of sentenced offenders in federal prison and 16% of state prisoners were serving time for drug offenses.</span></a>

<span style="font-weight: 400">This issue of the </span><a href="http://ssdp.org/news/blog/tag/monthly-mosaic/"><i><span style="font-weight: 400">Monthly Mosaic</span></i></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> will offer an in-depth view into the relationship between prisons and the War on Drugs.</span>

<blockquote><b>“</b><b>In the councils of government, we must guard against the acquisition of unwarranted influence, whether sought or unsought, by the military-industrial complex. </b><b>The potential for the disastrous rise of misplaced power exists and will persist.</b><b> We must never let the weight of this combination endanger our liberties or democratic processes. </b><b>We should take nothing for granted.</b><b>”</b></blockquote>

Many of these facilities punish, protect, house, or “treat” their young prisoners with the use of solitary confinement—for <a href="https://www.aclu.org/report/growing-locked-down-youth-solitary-confinement-jails-and-prisons-across-united-states">days, weeks, months, or even years at a time</a>. <a href="https://www.aclu.org/report/growing-locked-down-youth-solitary-confinement-jails-and-prisons-across-united-states">More than a third of adolescents behind bars had spent anywhere between one to six months in solitary confinement before their eighteenth birthday</a>.</p>

<blockquote><b>“</b><b>Solitary confinement can cause extreme psychological, physical, and developmental harm.</b><b> For children, who are still developing and more vulnerable to irreparable harm, the </b><b>risks are magnified</b><b> – particularly for kids with disabilities or histories of trauma and abuse. While confined, children are </b><b>regularly deprived</b><b> of the services, programming, and other tools that they need for healthy growth, education, and development.”</b></blockquote>

<span style="font-weight: 400">Today over </span><a href="http://bantheboxcampaign.org/?p=20#.V5U8J5PR9TY"><span style="font-weight: 400">45 cities and counties</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">—including New York City, Boston, Philadelphia, Atlanta, Chicago, Detroit, Seattle, and San Francisco—have </span><a href="http://bantheboxcampaign.org/?p=20#.V5U8J5PR9TY"><span style="font-weight: 400">removed the question regarding conviction history</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> from their employment applications. </span><a href="http://bantheboxcampaign.org/?p=20#.V5U8J5PR9TY"><span style="font-weight: 400">Seven states</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">—Hawaii, California, Colorado, New Mexico, Minnesota, Massachusetts, and Connecticut—have </span><a href="http://bantheboxcampaign.org/?p=20#.V5U8J5PR9TY"><span style="font-weight: 400">changed public employment hiring practices</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> to reduce discrimination based on arrest or conviction records. Certain cities and counties, as well as the whole state of Massachusetts, have r</span><a href="http://bantheboxcampaign.org/?p=20#.V5U8J5PR9TY"><span style="font-weight: 400">equired private employers to adopt ban the box policies</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">. Meanwhile, private employers across the country are </span><a href="http://bantheboxcampaign.org/?p=20#.V5U8J5PR9TY"><span style="font-weight: 400">voluntarily adopting ban the box</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> hiring policies.</span>
<blockquote><b>“</b><b>Any box that inquires into criminal history has a strong chilling effect</b><b> on applications in general&#8230;We know that when people see any box asking about their criminal background, a lot of them assume that they won’t have a chance to be admitted on their merits and they won’t pursue the process.”</b></blockquote>

In response to these concerning statistics, the Ban the Box movement has now set its sights on higher education, with some powerful allies helping to blaze the path forward. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">In May, Education Secretary John B.

<h2><b>Responding to People Who Argue for Prison/Jail Expansion</b></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400">Some public officials, like San Francisco’s former</span><a href="http://sanfrancisco.cbslocal.com/2013/10/10/sheriff-mirkarimi-looks-for-state-money-to-replace-2-aging-sf-jails/"><span style="font-weight: 400"> Sheriff Ross Mirakirimi</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">, have advocated for increased local spending towards jail construction, while at the same time using social justice rhetoric and quotes to feign support for criminal justice reform and human rights advocacy causes. On one hand, the Sheriff condemns the disproportionate and overpopulated African American representation in the carceral system. On the other hand, he </span><a href="http://www.sfweekly.com/thesnitch/2013/10/22/sheriff-ross-mirkarimi-asks-for-money-to-build-a-brand-new-jail"><span style="font-weight: 400">recommends the construction of new facilities</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> to disperse/distribute incarcerated peoples across multiple facilities to ease overcrowding.  </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">For example, Mirakirimi has </span><a href="http://www.sfsheriff.com/files/SFSD_PR_RM_09_10_15.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400">advocated for the construction of a new Women’s Jail Facility</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> in San Francisco, arguing that this new facility would not only decrease overcrowding at the local level, but also allocate funding and resources for trans* people undergoing transition. The framing of ‘lock-people-up-so-they-can-receive-services’ is all too common, but is faulty because it does not address the underlying issues surrounding systemic inequality, or carceral overcrowding. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">Instead of opting into policies that expand the prison/jail system for the sake of incremental shifts for access to resources, we should holistically reconsider the characteristics that make marginalized communities vulnerable to the risk of incarceration in the first place.
