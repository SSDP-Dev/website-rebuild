Students and SSDPers &#8211; Do you want to serve on SSDP&#8217;s <a href="http://ssdp.org/about/board/" target="_blank">Board of Directors</a>? Run for one of five open Student Director positions during Congress at the September conference!

<h2>Requirements:</h2>
<em>In order to apply/run for a student position on SSDP&#8217;s Board of Directors, you must be currently enrolled, part-time or full-time, in graduate school, college, or high school.</em>

Serving on the Board of Directors requires excellent written and verbal communication skills. In addition to your passion for social change and public policy, Student Directors also must be willing to perform basic administrative tasks and be comfortable regularly communicating via email and utilizing google docs. Most importantly, Student Directors must be able to devote a significant amount of time to Board tasks and assignments and be willing and able to regularly check and respond to email and phone communications on a daily basis. Student Directors must also fundraise for SSDP; each Director is expected to personally raise at least $1000 each year by asking friends, family and colleagues for donations.
