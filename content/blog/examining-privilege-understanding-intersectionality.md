<b>Intro</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">As much as we might like it to be the case, our society is not built on an even playing field. People from different walks of life face very different hardships, and, as a result, often have very different perspectives as well. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Understanding privilege and oppression is not just vital for navigating activist and social justice circles, but is also key to comprehending the state of modern politics.</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">As an activist community working in this space, it is important that SSDPers  recognize the privilege of the resources we have to do this work. It is imperative that we seek to empower marginalized individuals to share their life experiences and expertise rather than finding privileged others to speak for them.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">In this </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Monthly Mosaic</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, we’ll discuss what privilege means and how intersectionality comes into play. We’ll also examine privilege more deeply through the example of U.S. citizenship.</span>

&nbsp;

<b>What Is Privilege?</b>

<a href="https://everydayfeminism.com/2014/09/what-is-privilege/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">We can define privilege as a set of unearned benefits given to people who fit into a specific social group.</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> When one doesn’t experience a certain form of oppression, they have a privilege that the oppressed group does not.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Privilege amounts to issues, road blocks, glass ceilings, and slights that the privileged party doesn’t experience allowing them to move through life more easily and safely than those facing more obstacles along the same path.  This can be hard to see since the privileged person likely still has to work very hard to achieve success in their chosen endeavors. However, over time, a person who experiences oppression instead of privilege can end up with significantly different life circumstances than they would have if they were a member of the privileged party.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The privileged party may even be completely unaware of certain problems experienced by the oppressed party. For example, many White Americans were unaware of the violence that Black Americans often face at the hands of the police before the murder of Michael Brown; many able-bodied people fail to recognize how difficult the modern world can be to navigate for those with physical differences or disabilities; and, until the #MeToo campaign and similar efforts, many cis-men did not realize how pervasive sexual assault and sexual harassment against cis-women and trans people can be. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s important to note that </span><a href="https://msw.usc.edu/mswusc-blog/diversity-workshop-guide-to-discussing-identity-power-and-privilege/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">a person can be marginalized by one form of discrimination while still experiencing privilege in another aspect of their identity</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. In fact, most people experience some form of privilege due to their race, gender, level of ability, sexuality, class, religion, or any number of other aspects of their identity — no matter how marginalized they may otherwise be. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">For example, a  white, gay man might experience homophobia, but is privileged as far as not experiencing the same kind of sexism or racism that non-cis men and people of color frequently face.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">When dealing with social problems like the War on Drugs, it’s important to recognize that other people’s experiences may differ from your own  due to how various groups are affected by either privilege or oppression due to different aspects of their identities.</span>

&nbsp;

<strong>What Does Intersectionality Mean?</strong>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Within this framework of societal privileges and oppressions, cumulative forms of discrimination overlap, as people identify with several social categories that </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">intersect</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to form their personal identity. Intersectionality, coined by civil rights advocate and professor of law Kimberlé Crenshaw, refers to this intersection of several identities as an identity unique and different than the sum of its parts. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Crenshaw highlights the importance of intersectionality and how it affects our lens of social justice in </span><a href="https://www.ted.com/talks/kimberle_crenshaw_the_urgency_of_intersectionality"><span style="font-weight: 400;">this</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> TED talk. Early on in her speech, she asks every audience member to stand up, asking them to sit down if they were unfamiliar with names of individuals she lists off. After saying the names of several black boys and men that have been victims of police violence, most of the audience remains standing. When Crenshaw begins to say the names of black women that have been victims of police violence, however, the numbers of those left standing quickly drop. Crenshaw posits that oppression which occurs to individuals with several disprivileged characteristics is seen less frequently because these intersections do not fit with more common frames of discrimination (discrimination of one social class at a time).</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The utilization of intersectionality as a social justice frame directly affects discrimination law itself. The origin of the term “intersectionality” was to create a focusing point from which to see overlapping injustices, as explained by Crenshaw in her speech. How can a gender discrimination or race discrimination case be taken up by a black woman, as in Crenshaw’s example, when a company hires both black men and white women? Seen as separate discriminations, these views of social justice as separate parts create a “trickle down of social justice”, benefitting those who have more privilege to begin with. For more on Crenshaw and intersectionality, read her Truthout interview </span><a href="http://www.truth-out.org/opinion/item/40498-no-single-issue-politics-only-intersectionality-an-interview-with-kimberle-crenshaw"><span style="font-weight: 400;">here</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span>

&nbsp;

<strong>The Privilege of Citizenship</strong>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Activism can be much more risky for non-American citizens — whether or not they are undocumented — than it is for those born here or naturalized as citizens.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The narrative many undocumented immigrants carry with them as to why they chose to leave their countries are tied to narco-violence or a general lack of opportunities due to low economic development caused by regional instabilities resulting from the War on Drugs. These are powerful narratives that add an entirely new dimension to the fight against prohibition. However, these narratives may be kept away from the public eye because of fear for one’s personal safety. This is the dilemma of the undocumented activist; to be where one’s voice could be most effective while being forced to remain silent. While some do choose to be active and involved in order to speak for others, they do so at their own peril. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">A clear example of the personal damages of undocumented activism is the case of </span><a href="http://www.latimes.com/opinion/op-ed/la-oe-baker-marchevsky-rueda-deportation-20170608-story.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Claudia Rueda</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, an undocumented immigrant rights activist who was under the DACA program. Claudia and her family were detained and deported. Claudia’s case is not the only one, an excerpt from the LA Times reported: </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">“In March, undercover </span><a href="https://www.democracynow.org/2017/3/20/organizer_ice_detention_of_immigrant_rights"><span style="font-weight: 400;">ICE agents in Vermont</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> arrested three prominent undocumented activists associated with the group Migrant Justice, all of them under 25. In that same month, ICE agents in Mississippi detained 22-year-old DACA recipient </span><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2017/03/02/ice-nabs-young-dreamer-applicant-after-she-speaks-out-at-a-news-conference/?utm_term=.a744c2625f06"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Daniela Vargas</span></a> <span style="font-weight: 400;">after she spoke at a rally calling on the Trump administration to establish a path to citizenship for immigrants.”</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">In these cases we see that while a citizen is always in their right to protest and advocate, the undocumented members of our society do not have these same rights. Instead, they are faced with difficult choices. They can choose to stay quiet and hope for relative safety, or fight for one’s rights but risk throwing away years of sacrifice to be sent to a place where protesting comes with a whole new set of dangerous consequences.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The privilege of citizenship extends beyond the borders of the United States. Three years ago, the events </span><a href="https://nacla.org/ayotzinapa-timeline"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ayotzinapa</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> left many activists rattled. Although protests in the United States can reach levels of violence and civil disorder, they do not involve a direct collusion with government officials and organized crime. Forty-three Mexican student activists lost their lives in a simple protest in Mexico at the hands of the very same government they were protesting against. Simply put,  democratic process in many of our home countries has been corrupted and broken by centuries of colonialism and decades of prohibition. As a result, many of the things Americans are able to protest and express freely in the United States become matters of life or death for those seeking their rights abroad. Additionally, while both undocumented students and students in foreign countries face subversion, the methods are drastically different. Students abroad, like the 43 students of Ayotzinapa, risk their own lives to simply have their voices heard. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The privilege of an American citizenship manifests itself to the undocumented activist as a sense of safety. It is the idea that your home country is a place where you can be both free and heard. The reality that many undocumented student activists live in is one where their home country is not safe, and their country of residence is one where they cannot be heard. In essence, nowhere is truly safe for  expression and protest. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">It is important to note, however, that the same privilege that silences one section of the population can be used to help dismantle itself. Those of us who can speak and be heard safely and without fear could harness our privilege to fight for those of us who cannot. In fighting for immigrant rights we are fighting for families who have been victims of the War on Drugs. To truly be allies we cannot just help each other speak we must help each other be heard. So remember the next time you protest, lobby, or simply educate, you are doing so on behalf of millions of others who cannot. By carrying our voices and narratives with you, you can help us in our fight for our rights so that we may one day be able to speak safely.</span>
