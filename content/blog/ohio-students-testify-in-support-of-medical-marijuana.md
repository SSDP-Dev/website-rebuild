On January 30th, 2016, Ohio State Senators held a meeting to gauge residents&#8217; opinions on medical marijuana in the state. Chapter leaders from the University of Akron and Northeast Ohio Medical University Students for Sensible Drug Policy attended the meeting to testify in support of medical marijuana.

Below, watch a video of Alexander Dix, our Northeast Ohio Medical University chapter leader, providing his testimony.

I asked both Alexander and Khalil Smith, our University of Akron chapter leader, to briefly talk about the experience.

&#8220;The Ohio Senate Public Hearing for Medical Marijuana was quite moving. I heard about it from someone I met at the Women &amp; Entheogens conference and instantly knew I had to be there. I felt it was important for them to hear the perspective of a pharmacy student and future healthcare professional. I had no idea what to expect. As the first few parents got up to speak they brought their children with them, some of who had Tourette&#8217;s syndrome, OCD, and epilepsy, and it all became very real for me. It gave me strength to know that I&#8217;m going to make a difference in these people&#8217;s lives one day. I look forward to contributing all that I have to change the political and medical fields.&#8221;

&#8220;We first need to thank Senators Dave Burke and Kenny Yuko for allowing everyday citizens to pitch their testimonials, because many politicians could have easily closed their ears to the public opinion. The testimonials varied with each speaker. Some were emotional, providing touching stories about their loved ones in need of legal access to medical cannabis. Others were inspirational, rallying the audience, bringing them to their feet.

I learned a ton from attending this Town Hall meeting, whether it was statistical data supporting legalizing medical marijuana, or insight provided by those working in the legal system and the laboratories.

A truly valuable experience!&#8221;
