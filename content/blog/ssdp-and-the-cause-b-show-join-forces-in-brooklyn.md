IMMEDIATE RELEASE | BROOKLYN, NY



Thursday, August 16th <a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/1409146155963482/">&#8220;The Cause B Show: LIGHT em UP&#8221;</a>, at <a href="https://www.facebook.com/pages/Over-the-Eight/122374854615911">Over the Eight</a> (594 Union Ave, Union and Richardson) a stand-up comedy show featuring some of New York City&#8217;s top comedians raising money for Students for Sensible Drug Policy. The event is the third in a continuing series of shows produced solely to benefit causes in need. In addition to the creators, comedians in the line up include Mara Herron, Selena Coppock, Myka Fox, Katie Compa, Mookie Thompson, and Justy Dodge. We hope you will laugh with us in person while supporting this worthy cause.



<a href="https://www.facebook.com/TheCauseBShow?notif_t=page_new_likes">The Cause B Show</a> is the creation of comics Kerryn Feehan and Frank Liotti, along with local community organizer Victoria Varney (Greenpointers, Taste Williamsburg). Cause B Shows are performances by some of New York&#8217;s best comedians banding together to give voice to causes that are underrepresented, in the best way they know how; through laughter.



Wendy Cohen, a Fulbright Scholar with a focus on International Drug Policy and SSDP Alumni will be speaking at the event and available for Q&amp;A following the comics



Students for Sensible Drug Policy (SSDP) is an international grassroots network of students who are concerned about the impact drug abuse has on our communities, but who also know that the War on Drugs is failing our generation and our society.



SSDP forced Congress to scale back the Higher Education Act Aid Elimination Penalty, which prevents students with drug convictions from receiving financial aid. Nearly 200,00 would-be students have been affected by the penalty. SSDP mobilized 125 student governments to voice their opposition to the unjust policy, built a coalition of more than 300 prominent education, recovery, and civil rights organizations, and lobbied Congress aggressively for reform. As a result, the penalty no longer applies to those who are convicted of drug crimes while they are not in college and receiving financial aid. In other words, if a high school student or a person taking time off from school is convicted, their aid will not be affected when they return to school.



Come Support SSDP!<a href="/assets/2013/08/1014187_10151886903193072_613356146_n.jpg"><img class=" wp-image-9727 alignright" alt="1014187_10151886903193072_613356146_n" src="http://ssdp.org/assets/2013/08/1014187_10151886903193072_613356146_n.jpg" width="445" height="576" /></a>
