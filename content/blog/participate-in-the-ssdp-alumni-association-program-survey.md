Earlier this year, we launched the Students for Sensible Drug Policy <a href="http://ssdp.org/alumni">Alumni Association</a> to keep our activists engaged after they graduate. With over <a href="http://ssdp.org/alumni/members/">130 members in 65 cities</a> across the country, the Alumni Association continues to grow! Since the program is still in pilot phase, <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1948iWzPAjCCSqh-XK8t9TF6BXlRnkGZepLfnFIXYc1Q/viewform">we&#8217;re seeking feedback from all SSDP alumni</a> so we can make changes and improvements to better serve our network. In addition to helping us shape the Alumni Association, everyone who participates in the survey will be entered to win some exciting prizes! Two randomly selected winners will be able to choose between a $50 Amazon gift card or a free alumnus conference registration to attend SSDP2016 (April 15-17, 2016 in Washington, DC)!

<strong>Are you an SSDP alumnus? <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1948iWzPAjCCSqh-XK8t9TF6BXlRnkGZepLfnFIXYc1Q/viewform">Please take a few minutes to complete the SSDP Alumni Association program survey before July 31</a>.</strong>

<a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1948iWzPAjCCSqh-XK8t9TF6BXlRnkGZepLfnFIXYc1Q/viewform">This survey</a> is open to all SSDP alumni, regardless of your formal membership in the Alumni Association. Thanks in advance for your open and honest answers, we can&#8217;t address concerns or problems unless you tell us about them!

PURPOSE: The purpose of this survey is to obtain feedback on the Alumni Association. Since the program is still in pilot phase this year, your responses will inform any changes/improvements to how the program operates moving forward. You may participate in this survey anonymously, although you will not be entered to win one of the prizes (since we won&#8217;t know how to contact you!).

PRIZES: Everyone who provides an email address will be entered to win a prize! Two randomly selected winners will have their choice of either a free alumni conference registration to attend SSDP2016 (April 15-17, 2016 in Washington DC) OR a $50 Amazon gift card.

DEADLINE: Friday, July 31, 2015.
