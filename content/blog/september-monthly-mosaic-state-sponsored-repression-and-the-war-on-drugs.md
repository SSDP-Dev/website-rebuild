<h2>WHAT HAPPENED TO THE MISSING AYOTZINAPA STUDENTS?</h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400">On September 26th, 2014, five buses of Ayotzinapa students were attacked in and around the city of Iguala, Guerrero. That night, six people were killed, and 43 students were taken and put into police cars. To this day, </span><a href="http://ssdp.org/news/blog/call-to-action-demand-justice-for-ayotzinapa-victims-and-an-end-to-state-sponsored-repression/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400">the truth of the events of that night and the fate of the 43 are unknown</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">. Unfortunately, </span><a href="http://ssdp.org/news/blog/call-to-action-demand-justice-for-ayotzinapa-victims-and-an-end-to-state-sponsored-repression/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400">Ayotzinapa is not the first or only case of forced disappearances to which the Mexican government has been tied</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">.
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">On July 31st, the </span><a href="http://www.oas.org/en/iachr/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400">Inter-American Commission on Human Rights</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> approved the </span><a href="http://www.oas.org/es/acerca/mecanismos.asp" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400">Mecanismo de Seguimiento</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">, one of the demands of the families of Ayotzinapa, to continue an independent investigation into the case. </span><span style="font-weight: 400">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">A previous independent international investigation by the Grupo Interdisciplinario de Expertos Independientes (GIEI) was </span><span style="font-weight: 400"><a href="http://www.latintimes.com/ayotzinapa-experts-say-mexican-government-banned-investigation-find-43-missing-388629" target="_blank">blocked by the Mexican government</a> </span><span style="font-weight: 400">after the group publicly </span><a href="http://www.latintimes.com/ayotzinapa-evidence-contradicts-enrique-pena-nieto-story-case-43-disappeared-students-339803" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400">contradicted</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> official reports. In their second report, “</span><a href="https://www.oas.org/es/cidh/actividades/giei/GIEI-InformeAyotzinapa2.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400">Informe Ayotzinapa II</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">,” the GIEI wrote that their expulsion only strengthens their lack of confidence in the institutions of Mexico’s  federal government. They argue that if the federal government can, in the presence of an internationally supervised body, still act with such levels of impunity, omission, and intentional interference and delay, it is indispensable to continue with a mechanism of international oversight until justice and truth are reached. </span><span style="font-weight: 400">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">Meanwhile, the </span><a href="http://www.eaaf.org/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400">Argentine Forensic Anthropology Team</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">,  a non-profit scientific organization that applies forensic sciences to the investigation of human rights violations,</span> <a href="http://www.drugpolicy.org/blog/murders-dont-stop-war-drugs-responsible-outrageous-death-toll-mexico" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400">uncovered 60 mass graves while searching for the disappeared students</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">. However, of the remains identified, </span><a href="http://www.drugpolicy.org/blog/murders-dont-stop-war-drugs-responsible-outrageous-death-toll-mexico" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400">none belonged to the 43 missing Ayotzinapa students</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">. </span>

<a href="http://www.bbc.com/mundo/noticias-america-latina-37370151" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400">Tomás Zerón, the head of the criminal investigation agency similar to the FBI, recently resigned in connection to the Ayotzinapa disappearances</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">. He has been accused by multiple reports of  falsifying the little forensic evidence available—a piece of bone—and tying the evidence to a grave site where the Mexican government claims the students were buried. The GIEI report would later reveal that it was unlikely the grave site was the final destination for any of the victims. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">The victims&#8217; families are still campaigning to find out the truth, but with so much confusion and obfuscation on the part of the government, it is highly doubtful there will be any resolution for either the families or the people of Mexico. </span><a href="http://www.telesurtv.net/english/news/Disappearances-Still-Rising-in-Mexico-2-Years-After-Ayotzinapa-20160907-0024.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400">Disappearances continue to rise</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">, </span><a href="http://www.voanews.com/a/violence-among-mexican-drug-gangs-seen-increasing/3498456.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400">the drug war rages on</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">, and </span><a href="http://ssdp.org/news/blog/call-to-action-demand-justice-for-ayotzinapa-victims-and-an-end-to-state-sponsored-repression/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400">another anniversary comes and goes</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">The one positive is that the work of these international teams and the continued resilience of the families has brought much-needed publicity to  the larger human rights crisis in Mexico. </span>

<h2>SSDP DEMANDS JUSTICE FOR AYOTZINAPA VICTIMS.</h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400">To honor this important issue, SSDP released an </span><a href="http://ssdp.org/assets/SSDP-Ayotzinapa-Organizing-Guide.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400">Ayotzinapa Organizing Guide</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> for students around the world who want to get involved.</span>

<div id="attachment_19955" style="width: 420px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://ssdp.org/assets/SSDP-Ayotzinapa-Organizing-Guide.pdf" target="_blank"><img class="wp-image-19955 size-full" src="http://ssdp.org/assets/Screen-Shot-2016-09-26-at-10.16.06-AM.png" alt="Ayotzinapa Organizing Guide" width="410" height="528" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Ayotzinapa Organizing Guide</p></div>

<span style="font-weight: 400">Meanwhile, several students, including SSDPers have been active in the fight for justice, since the disappearances first occurred.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">A month after the disappearances, a student at the University of San Francisco reached out to the school’s president, convincing the president to release</span><a href="http://ssdp.org/assets/SSDP-Ayotzinapa-Organizing-Guide.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400"> a letter</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> taking a public stand against violence.  </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">In November of the same year, two students from San Diego City College organized a </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6_vUaPE66I" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400">march to the Mexican Consulate on the International Day of Action</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">, facilitating transnational activism by bringing together 400 students from local San Diego and Tijuana colleges. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">The University of California-Berkeley chapter has been particularly vociferous, hosting monthly vigils on the 26th of every month, displaying 43 chairs to commemorate the lives of the students lost in the Ayotzinapa disappearances. Each month, students and members of the community come together to remember the lives of those who continue to seek justice from Mexican government officials.</span>

<div id="attachment_19956" style="width: 610px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="/assets/13509109_10154162387430767_4478664616057553658_n.jpg"><img class="wp-image-19956" src="http://ssdp.org/assets/13509109_10154162387430767_4478664616057553658_n-300x300.jpg" alt="Students at the University of California Berkeley raise public awareness about the disappearances. " width="600" height="600" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Students at the University of California Berkeley raise public awareness about the disappearances.</p></div>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400">UC Berkeley chapter members have also been working with the </span><a href="https://www.facebook.com/contrarepresionmex/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400">Caravana Contra La Represión En México</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">. The caravan’s objectives are to support Mexican social movements and denounce government repression, including but not limited to disappearances, assassinations, political prisoners, land grabs, and femicides. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">The caravan will be stopping in various cities across California, Illinois, and New York to raise awareness for Ayotzinapa and eight other  social movements, and will make Bay Area appearances November 3rd to speak to students about the issues facing Mexican Citizens concerning the War on Drugs and drug crime. For more information, stay in touch with the caravan via </span><a href="https://www.facebook.com/contrarepresionmex/?ref=page_internal" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400">Facebook</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> or their </span><a href="http://www.contrarepresionmex.org/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400">website</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">. </span>
