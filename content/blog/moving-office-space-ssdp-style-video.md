<img class="alignleft" src="http://ssdp.org/assets/images/blog/2011/may/destroying_office.jpg" alt="Destroying the office" width="256" height="236" />After about a decade in our national headquarters on Connecticut Avenue, this is our last day here. While we&#8217;re sad to say goodbye, we&#8217;re excited about our new office space in downtown Washington, D.C. We&#8217;ll tell you more about our new space soon and include some video. But for now, remember that part from the movie, Office Space, where employees took a baseball bat to the hated printer?

Please <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIHzOXOwhdg">enjoy this video of our </a><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIHzOXOwhdg">Associate Director, Stacia Cosner, </a><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIHzOXOwhdg">totally destroying trashed office furniture</a> with a baseball bat so that it can be transported to the dump. Dedicated readers may recall that <a href="http://daregeneration.blogspot.com/2011/05/its-just-softball-game-vs-drug-czars.html">Stacia represents SSDP on the Capitol Hemp One-Hitters</a>, a team in the Congressional Softball League made up of drug policy reform activists, so it shouldn&#8217;t be any surprise that she&#8217;s got a mean swing.
