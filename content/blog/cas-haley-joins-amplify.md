SSDP&#8217;s AMPLIFY Project is proud to announce Cas Haley as our newest addition to the AMPLIFY artist family! We&#8217;re excited to add an artist that has proved determination, hard work, and good vibes can take you a long way (not to mention incredible talent!). Head over to his <a href="http://www.facebook.com/haley.cas">facebook page</a> and show him some love! Cas&#8217; story is pretty cool:

<em>His crystalline voice and funky, easygoing beats earned Cas Haley a second-place finish on America’s Got Talent, which in turn netted him a measure of fame and a following. But the contest also locked the Texan singer/songwriter/guitarist into a major label deal that didn’t feel right. So, not wanting to be turned into a manufactured product, he struck out on his own. Connection, his Easy Star Records debut, is aptly named. It’s all about those deep-running connections that make him what he is—those unbreakable links between artist and audience, between styles of music, between art and life, and most of all, between all people. As Cas points out, reggae’s core message is, after all, &#8220;one love.&#8221;</em>

Cas is about to hit the road with AMPLIFY artists Easy Star All Stars and The Green just in time for spring. What better way to warm up after a chilly winter than <a href="http://ssdp.org/amplify/students">signing up your SSDP chapter for some of these shows</a>?
