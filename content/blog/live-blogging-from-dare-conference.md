I&#8217;m sitting in a session that&#8217;s about parents who provide alcohol to teenagers in controlled settings and how &#8220;irresponsible&#8221; those parents are.

The instructor just gave a speech about harm reduction actually being &#8220;harm promotion&#8221; and made an analogy about parents teaching their kids how to &#8220;shoplift responsibly.&#8221;

Riiiight. Perfect analogy. Because every high school student shoplifts the night of prom and then tries to drive home while putting on the dress/tux they just snatched up, resulting in deadly collisions.

The logic is flawless.
