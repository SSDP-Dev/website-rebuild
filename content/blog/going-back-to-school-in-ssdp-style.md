Over the next few weeks, thousands of SSDPers will be returning to campuses across the US, and our international outreach team has been hard at work getting prepared for the hustle bustle of the 2012-2013 school year. We have some exciting things to announce, and we hope that our work will make it easy for you to transition back to campus smoothly.



<strong>Updated Student Resources</strong>



We have spent the past few weeks updating many of our student resources on our website. We recently released the <a href="http://ssdp.org/resources/student-organizing-manual/">2012-2013 Student Organizing Manual</a>, which is your how-to-guide on everything SSDP. If you are just starting a chapter, or leading an established chapter, this guide is going to be your best friend!



In case you didn’t hear, we recently got a <a href="http://ssdp.org//assets/2012/05/new-logo-from-saul-refined-white-bg.jpg">new logo</a>! We have updated our <a href="http://ssdp.org/resources/stock-images/">stock images</a> to provide our chapters with the new logo, and we also just uploaded high definition images so you can create an awesome banner or T-shirt for your chapter today. So, go check them out!



Do you plan on lobbying this semester? We hope so! If you do, we recently released our <a href="http://ssdp.org/resources/ssdp-lobbying-guide/">SSDP Student Lobbying Guide</a>. This has everything you need to schedule a lobbying meeting with your elected representatives to discuss sensible policy change on the state and federal level. So, take a look and start making those meetings today!



Is anyone in your chapter looking to run for Student Government this semester? Maybe you should take a look at the <a href="http://ssdp.org/resources/ssdp-student-government-takeover-manual/">SSDP Student Government Takeover Manual</a>. This guide was created by SSDPers, and covers strategies and tactics you can use to take control of your student government and bring some sensibility to the table.



Also, don’t forget to take a peek at our updated <a href="http://ssdp.org/resources/meeting-tips">meeting</a>, <a href="http://ssdp.org/resources/chapter-event-tips">event</a>, and <a href="http://ssdp.org/resources/chapter-fundraising-tips/">fundraising</a> tip pages. We hope all of these updated resources can serve you this year, and if you need any additional help, don’t forget to ask your Outreach Coordinator for help!



<strong>New DARE Parody T-shirts are in! </strong>



You asked for them, and we brought them back. Make sure to get your limited edition <a href="https://salsa.democracyinaction.org/o/1259/t/13106/shop/shop.jsp?storefront_KEY=870">“DARE to resist the war on drugs” </a>SSDP t-shirt today. We have under 100 left in stock, so be sure to order some for your chapter, friends, family, or even yourself!



<strong>SSDP Leadership Webinar Series</strong>



This summer, we released our new <a href="http://ssdp.org/resources/ssdp-leadership-webinar-series/">Leadership Webinar Series</a> aimed at training students to employ effective methods for recruiting new chapter members, delegating chapter responsibility, fundraising for your chapter, and passing the torch to new leaders. We are going to continue this webinar series, so please sign up today. We hope to train all of our students to become better campus advocates for sensible drug policy reform.



<strong>Voter Registration</strong>



It’s almost November, and you know what that means&#8230;Election time! If you are now eligible to vote for the first time, or just need to re-register in the district of your college or university, take a second to register to vote with SSDP and our <a href="http://ssdp.org/resources/voter-registration/">Rock The Vote registration tool</a> built right into our website. We want to make sure that you can have a voice when it comes to important issues this fall. Especially all of our students in Colorado, Washington, and Oregon who have the opportunity to vote on marijuana legalization as it hits the ballot for the first time! So, start sharing this with your chapter today!



<strong>Legislative Bill Tracking</strong>



At SSDP, we know how hard it can be to keep track of what&#8217;s going on in congress, so let us help. We have put together a <a href=" http://ssdp.org/resources/bill-tracker/">Bill Tracking Resource Center</a> that lists some of the important pieces of legislation you may want to take action on. Take a look today, and continue to check in as we will be updating it whenever important legislation gets introduced.
