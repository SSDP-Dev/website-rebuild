While my last post made light of the situation in El Paso, this event proved to be an important day for drug policy. Even though mayor Cook&#8217;s veto was not overridden by the city council, councilman O&#8217;Rourke&#8217;s goal to stimulate dialogue about ending prohibition was achieved. Over 40 people testified their support or disagreement with the veto&#8217;s override. It seemed like most supported keeping all options on the table and not limiting discussion &#8211; whether or not they personally supported legalization.

<a href="http://www.ssdp.org/elpaso">Nubia Legarda</a>, a University of Texas at El Paso student, testified on behalf of SSDP in support of the amendment that would include the discussion of ending prohibition as an option to curb the escalating violence in Juarez. Nubia has family in Juarez and provided a touching and articulate testimony that made SSDP proud!

Immediately after the city council meeting, Nubia made a $10 <a href="http://www.ssdp.org/donate">donatation</a> to SSDP! Thank her by matching her donation today!
