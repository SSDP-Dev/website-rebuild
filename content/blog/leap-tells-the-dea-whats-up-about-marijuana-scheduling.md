Last week the American Medical Association (AMA) announced its support of <a href="http://www.headcount.org/blog/?p=3227">removing marijuana from Schedule I</a> status. The AMA has refused to budge on this for a long time now, and opponents of marijuana law reform often cite the organization’s stance in their argument that pot prohibition is a good thing.

The DEA hasn&#8217;t made a stink about the announcement but I highly doubt they&#8217;re happy about it. Yesterday, however, the agency removed that particular bulletpoint from its list of <a href="http://www.justice.gov/dea/concern/marijuana.html">reasons why pot should remain illegal.</a>

What made them take down the bulletpoint? I doubt they were worried about misinformation since the rest of the website is full of it. I think it was <a href="http://www.headcount.org/blog/www.askleap.org" target="_blank">Law Enforcement Against Prohibition (LEAP)</a>, a group of police officers, judges, lawyers, and many other law-enforcement officials who oppose drug prohibition. LEAP organized a <a href="http://org2.democracyinaction.org/o/5663/t/5525/campaign.jsp?campaign_KEY=2272">letter-writing campaign</a> to Attorney General Eric Holder requesting the site be updated and bam! it was taken down a week later.

I guess I&#8217;m left to wonder, if the DEA were truly transparent, as it claims to be, wouldn’t it not only remove the previous AMA position but replace it with the association’s new stance?
