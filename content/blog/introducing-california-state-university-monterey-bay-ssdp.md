<strong>How did you hear about SSDP? </strong>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">I first heard about SSDP while attending Psychedelic Science 2017. </span>

<strong>Why did you want to get involved/what made you decide to start a chapter? </strong>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">As an undergraduate student, it is difficult to become a psychedelic researcher, but I still wanted to get involved. I am passionate about sensible drug education so when I found out about SSDP also having material for sensible drug education I knew that I had to bring it to my campus.</span>

<strong>What has the reception been like on campus? From students, teachers, administration, etc. </strong>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">I was seamlessly able to find an adviser and individuals who are interested in educating about harm reduction and safe usage. Additionally, I did not encounter any hurdles put up by the administration. In fact, the person in charge of student affairs expressed that it is a good club to have on campus</span>

<strong>What are some of the things you have planned or want to plan for next semester? </strong>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Next semester I am looking forward to training new officers and working through the drug education materials. Since I am graduating I want to establish a strong and interested cabinet that will keep the club alive and thriving.</span>

<strong>What are you most excited about for your chapter/school/state/region/ssdp/drug policy right now?</strong>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">I am most excited about broadening my knowledge of substances and spreading sensible information to those around me.</span>

<strong>What is your vision for California State University, Monterey Bay? Where do you see your chapter in a year? in 4 or 5 years?</strong>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">My vision for California State University, Monterey Bay is to not only supply information to the campus, but to work on harm reduction in Monterey County!</span>
