I am thrilled to announce the formation of our newest official chapter, <a title="UIW" href="http://ssdp.org/chapters/southern/texas/university-of-the-incarnate-word-uiw/" target="_blank">University of the Incarnate Word (UIW)</a>!



UIW is a private Catholic university located in San Antonio, Texas, just a short drive from the Mexico &#8211; US border. I spoke with chapter founder and leader Margarita McAuliffe about her experience with building the chapter and her  plans for the chapter moving forward;



&nbsp;



<b>How did you hear about SSDP?</b>



I first learned about SSDP at the 2011 <a title="DPA" href="http://www.drugpolicy.org/" target="_blank">Drug Policy Alliance</a> conference in Los Angelos, where I met a few SSDPers.



&nbsp;



<b>Why did you want to get involved/what made you decide to start a chapter?</b>



<b></b>There were no chapters in San Antonio and only one other chapter in all of <a title="Texas SSDP chapters" href="http://ssdp.org/chapters/southern/texas/" target="_blank">Texas</a>. I’m very impressed with the work that SSDP does and I wanted to make that happen here. Students here are hungry for this information. They&#8217;re hungry for change and they want to be involved in that change.



&nbsp;



<b>What has the reception been like on campus?</b>



<b></b>The reception has been extremely positive &#8211; most students are eager to participate, and faculty are very supportive. The staff member who helped with the paperwork for establishing the chapter even expressed interest in joining.



&nbsp;



<b>What are some of the things you have planned or want to plan for next semester?</b>



<b></b>We were just approved as a student organization, so we haven’t yet had a chance to meet and plan. I personally hope we’ll host a few film screenings, engage in some lobbying and educating (students and the community at large), and even attend a drug policy conference. We&#8217;re also planning for lots of fun!



&nbsp;



<b>What is the most challenging part of your experience starting/running the chapter so far? </b>



<b></b>The university bureaucracy and paperwork requirements.



&nbsp;



<b>What is the most rewarding part?</b>



<b></b>Getting to meet and talk with students at all levels about drug policy. And organizing!



&nbsp;



<b>What are you most excited about for your chapter right now?</b>



<b></b>That we are organizing!



&nbsp;



<b>What is your vision for UIW SSDP? Where do you see your chapter in a year? in 4 or 5 years?</b>



<b></b>I am a doctoral student who earned a B.A. in 1975. I foresee the chapter being run by undergraduates in a year, working to educate the university community and reaching out to students on other campuses in San Antonio. In 4 or 5 years I hope the chapter will have greatly expanded in membership and will be a go-to source for drug policy information and support, and for interns/employees for organizations that work on drug policy reform.
