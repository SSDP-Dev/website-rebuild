In addition, Balko has criticized the priorities of police, noting that the incentives are much greater for them to go after non-violent, consenting drug users than people who commit <a title="rape or assault" href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/05/29/priorities_0_n_3353199.html" target="_blank">rape or assault</a>.



Balko’s book, <i>Rise of the Warrior Cop,</i> looks more deeply into the new military-like police. It follows the transition of SWAT teams to fight the war on drugs and examines the police of today, who are routinely trained by current or former members of the military and who use these skills to raid the homes of peaceful medical marijuana users in the dead of night.



Radley Balko will discuss his book at Busboys and Poets on 5<sup>th</sup> and K in Washington, D.C. at 6:30pm on July 23<sup>rd</sup>.
