Over the years, I have had the opportunity to converse with many Students for Sensible Drug Policy alumni, former SSDP staff members, and historic allies about the history of SSDP and the diversity of its membership. I have come to learn that the values of inclusion and advocacy on behalf of marginalized communities have been with the organization since its inception. But, let’s face it: at its founding, and in the years that followed, the SSDP network was more white, more wealthy, and more male-gendered than the general youth population of the United States. Despite this, many of the folks who were involved with SSDP during its infancy worked very hard to ensure that the values mentioned above were woven into the fabric of the organization from the start. That work has paid off. Since I joined SSDP staff 2 and a half years ago, it has been heartening to see how the face of SSDP is continuing to change, with more women, people of color, and LGBT members in the network and in positions of prominence than ever before.

<span style="font-weight: 400;">When I was elected to SSDP’s Board of Directors in 2013, the primary argument I made to the network as a candidate was about our authenticity and how it could suffer if we did not actively work to include more people of color, women, and other oppressed minorities. My assertion was that being inclusive of these most vulnerable groups among us was not enough and that we must actively reach out and invite them into our organization at all levels, including positions of power and authority. Since that time, we have seen SSDP hire a woman as Executive Director, and have had two women serve consecutively as the Chairperson of the Board of Directors. In fact, in 2014-15 the four most senior members of our organization on staff and Board were women- a fact that distinguishes us from every other national drug policy reform organization in the U.S.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">I had the wonderful fortune of being hired by SSDP in 2014. As the months have passed, I have struggled to determine how to use my influence as a staff member to help diversify our network; most specifically, how to ensure that we have more students of color in our network. Happily, the work that SSDP chapters are engaged in attracts the attention of local activists who are also working in the realm of drug policy reform and in the cannabis industry. Several of them, who are graduates of Historically Black Colleges &amp; Universities (HBCUs), have taken note of SSDP and are determined to help us ensure that HBCU campuses are present in our network. This work will contribute to our authenticity as an organization advocating on behalf of the communities of color being disproportionately impacted by the war on drugs, and will help us amplify the voices of more young, black Americans within our network and beyond. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">It is with great pleasure that I introduce four community members, and one SSDP alumni, who have volunteered to join our HBCU working group. Their approach will be to act as ambassadors at their alma maters and to interact with and recruit students of color and allies on other campuses. It is also worth noting that many HBCU campuses have very harsh penalties for cannabis possession, including immediate dorm evictions. We will be working with the new HBCU chapters as they form to advocate for more sensible policies on HBCU campuses.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
