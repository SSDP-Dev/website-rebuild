But the music isn&#8217;t over. AMPLIFY bands <a href="http://www.giantpandadub.com/">Giant Panda Guerilla Dub Squad</a> and <a href="http://www.rootsofcreation.com/">Roots of Creation</a> both have great fall tours planned. Not only do these bands know how to jam, they support important social causes and the organizations behind them, like SSDP. Dates posted below.



Are you in an SSDP chapter and see your town on the lists below? Head over to ssdp.org/amplify/students and sign up to volunteer for the AMPLIFY project. You&#8217;ll get a chance to help promote the tour and get your chapter a table at the venue the night of the show!
