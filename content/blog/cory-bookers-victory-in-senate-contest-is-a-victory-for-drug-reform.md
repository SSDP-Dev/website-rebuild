Newark Mayor Cory Booker won the Democratic primary election last night, setting him up as the expected winner in the contest for New Jersey&#8217;s open Senate seat. Booker&#8217;s victory in the general election is not certain, but it&#8217;s pretty close to a sure thing, which means he is now poised to become the most vehement advocate for drug policy reform in the Senate.



In December, Booker said, &#8220;We need to change, I believe, radically change the national conversation and begin to talk about drugs — especially drugs like pot — in a different way.” He also <a href="http://www.rawstory.com/rs/2012/12/18/cory-booker-we-must-radically-change-this-drug-war-insanity/" target="_blank">noted how important this is to him</a>. &#8220;This is a conversation that, no matter what I do — mayor, governor, senator — I want to be one of the people hopefully trying to lead the national conversation away from this insanity that we have right now,&#8221; he said.



And we badly need him in the Senate. The chamber&#8217;s only other frequent and ardent critic of the drug war — Sen. Rand Paul (R-KY) — is sometimes <a href="http://www.politico.com/blogs/politico-live/2013/03/paul-i-dont-promote-marijuana-160075.html" target="_blank">less-than-stellar in his rhetoric</a>. He referred to marijuana users as &#8220;lazy&#8221; in a March interview. He also said, &#8220;I think even marijuana is a bad thing to do. I think it takes away your incentive to work and show up and do the things that you should be doing. I don&#8217;t think that it&#8217;s a good idea.&#8221; That Paul is the best we have in the Senate right now is unsettling.



Booker&#8217;s entry into the Senate could be even more substantial for us because of his star power. Not only is he a genuine hero — in 2012, he <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/04/13/nyregion/newark-mayor-cory-booker-saves-woman-from-house-fire.html?_r=0" target="_blank">ran into a burning building to rescue a woman</a> — he also has the potential for a meteoric rise. This morning, following the news of his victory, a <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-fix/wp/2013/08/14/why-cory-booker-will-become-the-highest-profile-democratic-senator/" target="_blank">Washington Post columnist wrote</a>, &#8220;from the get-go, he would be poised to become the highest-profile member of the Democratic Caucus.&#8221;



Booker&#8217;s victory comes in the wake of a major announcement on Monday by Attorney General Eric Holder that the Department of Justice will modify it&#8217;s prosecutorial procedures in order to avoid triggering mandatory minimum prison sentences for non-violent drug offenders who are not connected to a larger criminal organization. While that announcement was a welcome step in the right direction, <a href="http://ssdp.org/news/blog/eric-holder-announces-changes-in-doj-drug-sentencing-reform/" target="_blank">it&#8217;s not far enough</a>. But Holder&#8217;s announcement has sparked a needed discussion on the topic and has galvanized support from <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/14/opinion/smarter-sentencing.html" target="_blank">editorial boards across the country</a>. Booker&#8217;s triumph also comes on the heels of a federal judge on Monday <a href="http://ssdp.org/news/blog/judge-declares-nypd-stop-and-frisk-unconstitutional/" target="_blank">declaring the &#8220;Stop and Frisk&#8221; policy unconstitutional</a> and the Comptroller of New York City <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/national/ap-exclusive-nyc-comptroller-liu-wants-marijuana-legalized/2013/08/13/d95acebe-0491-11e3-bfc5-406b928603b2_story.html" target="_blank">this morning calling for the legalization of marijuana</a>.



This confluence of events is yet another indication that the tide has shifted our way. The implications of Booker&#8217;s victory on drug policy could be the best — yet least noticed — news for our movement in what has shaped up to be a week filled with good news.
