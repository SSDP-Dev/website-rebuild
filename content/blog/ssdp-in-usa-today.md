Last week, the White House&#8217;s drug czar, Gil Kerlikowske, made news by blaming an increase in teen marijuana use on medical marjuana laws, saying that the laws send the &#8220;wrong message&#8221; to teens.  We helped make sure that Brown University <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/news/washington/story/2011-09-08/National-drug-survey-shows-big-drop-in-methamphetamine-use/50309360/1">SSDP chapter activist Rebecca McGoldrick was quoted in a USA Today article countering Kerlikowske&#8217;s outrageous claim</a>, where she noted her own pain and nausea from fibromyalgia.

<blockquote>&#8220;Most of my friends are still unaware of its legal status as a medicine,&#8221; said McGoldrick, who is involved with Students for Sensible Drug Policy, which advocates decriminalization of drug use.



The legal status didn&#8217;t influence whether they smoked marijuana, she said.



&#8220;I have plenty of friends who choose to use it and plenty who don&#8217;t choose to,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I think it&#8217;s an alternative to alcohol for some people.&#8221;</blockquote>

Thanks to Rebecca for speaking truth to power — way to go!  Stay tuned later in the week for video footage of SSDP staff confronting the White House drug czar last week at the National Press Club.
