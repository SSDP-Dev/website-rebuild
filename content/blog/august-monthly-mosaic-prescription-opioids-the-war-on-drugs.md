&#8212;&#8211;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">In response to current discussions and misconceptions surrounding opioid prescription use, and because </span><a href="https://www.overdoseday.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">International Overdose Awareness Day</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is just around the corner on August 31st, the Diversity Awareness Reflection and Education (DARE) committee thought it pertinent to dedicate August’s Monthly Mosaic to Prescription Opioids &amp; the War on Drugs.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">There is a lot of animosity toward pharmaceuticals, especially opioids. Common opioids include schedule II substances such as morphine,  fentanyl, hydrocodone, and oxycodone; and heroin, which is a Schedule I substance. Opioids are commonly prescribed to treat pain, but they may be used by individuals for a variety of reasons. As a reaction to the increases in opioid overdoses, misconceptions are being spread about prescription painkillers leading to opioid use disorder. These misconceptions are further skewed to paint those who develop an opioid use disorder as “chasing highs” until it destroys or ends their lives. It is understandable that people want to react strongly to the opioid crisis &#8212; between the years of 2000 and 2014, the United States experienced a </span><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm6450a3.htm"><span style="font-weight: 400;">200% rise</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in the rate of opioid overdose deaths. However, much of the current discussion is not in line with evidence, and spreading this misinformation only further harms both those who need access to opioids for pain management and people who struggle with problematic opioid use. This issue deserves more nuanced discussion and evidence-based solutions. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">In recent years, the conversations around people who use drugs has shifted. Although our laws are slow to reflect it, many people now understand problematic drug use as a public health issue instead of a criminal one. While this is certainly a good step toward  respecting people who use drugs, it is important to note that it is not a coincidence that our understanding and compassion for people who struggle with drug use has improved </span><a href="https://medium.com/@SonofBaldwin/the-media-treats-white-drugs-addicts-like-angels-who-lost-their-way-and-treats-black-drug-addicts-d193d42ea208"><span style="font-weight: 400;">as the faces of those people changed</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The drug crisis in white communities today dwarfs the crack epidemic that decimated communities of color in the 80s, but the media does not blame “white culture” for this crisis, and police departments do not target whites when enforcing drug laws. This is not to say that we should stop progressing now &#8212; rather we acknowledge the role race plays in public perception of people who use drugs.</span>

&#8212;&#8211;

<b>MEDICAL VERSUS NONMEDICAL USE</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">From a more medical perspective, a few things are considered when determining medical vs non-medical use (note &#8211; this is not necessarily OUR perception, rather how it may be perceived by those not as sensitive to the issues). The first common determinant is </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">intent</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> &#8212; whether the drug is used to treat a medical problem, or to “get high” or “self-medicate.” The </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">effect </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">of the drug is also considered &#8212; whether the drug helps the person in question live a better life or negatively impacts their quality of life. Another determinant is </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">control </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8212; whether the drug use is controlled by the physician or the person taking the drug. </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Legality</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is also considered &#8212; is the person in question taking the drug as it is prescribed to them, or are they taking a drug prescribed to another person or an unprescribed substance? Finally, the </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">pattern</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of drug use is considered &#8212; is the person in question using the drug at a moderate dose and as prescribed, or are they taking it in social settings and/or mixed with other drugs? </span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">During the 2015 </span><a href="https://nsduhweb.rti.org/respweb/homepage.cfm"><span style="font-weight: 400;">NSDUH</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> survey, participants were asked why they use prescription drugs  non-medically, and their responses included to relieve physical pain, relax or relieve tension, help with sleep, help with feelings or emotions, experiment or see what it is like, feel good or get high, increase or decrease effects of other drugs, ‘because I am hooked or have to have it,’ help lose weight, help concentrate, help be alert or stay awake, help study, or some other reason. The first few of these results especially suggest there exists a false dichotomy between medical and non-medical use; indeed, many who by these standards are taking a drug non-medically are using it to treat medical problems. For the sake of simplicity,  we shall differentiate between medical and non-medical use based on whether or not someone is taking a drug as it is prescribed to them, but we acknowledge that non-medical use can be beneficial as well.</span>

&#8212;&#8211;

<b>OPIOIDS AND SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">It is a popular belief that if you are prescribed an opioid, you will develop an opioid use disorder. In contrast, prescribing painkillers did not cause the opioid epidemic, and painkillers do not have as high an addiction potential as one might think. Rates of carefully diagnosed substance use disorder average </span><a href="http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMra1507771#t=article"><span style="font-weight: 400;">less than 8%</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> among people taking prescribed opioids long-term, and rates of opioid use disorder among people who take opioids as prescribed short-term are even lower, </span><a href="https://tonic.vice.com/en_us/article/a3z98b/big-pharma-didnt-cause-the-opioid-crisis-most-pain-patients-dont-get-addicted"><span style="font-weight: 400;">averaging less than 1%</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. It is also important to keep in mind that much of the long-term use we see would not qualify as a substance use disorder, and is considered pain management. People can develop problematic relationships with opioids for a variety of reasons, but the narrative of short-term pain patients getting hooked on their medications represents a very small minority. Plenty of those who use opioids, medically or non-medically, manage regular use without a problem. In fact, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">most </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">people who use drugs </span><a href="http://www.thecleanslate.org/reality-check-most-dont-become-addicted/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">never develop a substance use disorder.</span></a>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">For those who do struggle with opioid use disorder, we might be thinking incorrectly about what that means. It was already mentioned above that attitudes toward problematic drug use have shifted from a moral failing to a public health issue, with many now asserting that addiction is a disease. However, new research suggests it may be even more accurately described as a </span><a href="http://www.slate.com/articles/life/education/2016/04/is_addiction_a_learning_disorder.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">learning disorder</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. In this description, developing a substance use disorder starts with the person learning that the drug helps relieve some other problem they are experiencing, such as anxiety or depression.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Regardless of what causes people to develop problematic relationships to opioids, recovery looks different for everybody. For some people who struggle with their opioid use, abstinence may be the only way they are able to feel in control of their lives. For others, recovery looks like less chaotic, but continued, opioid use. </span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Whatever recovery looks like for each individual, there are evidence-based treatments available for people who struggle with opioid use and seek recovery; and while 12-step, abstinence-only programs may work for some, they are not the only option, and may not the best option. Medication Assisted Therapy (MAT) is a treatment that involves providing people seeking treatment with substances such as </span><a href="https://www.addictioncenter.com/treatment/medications/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">methadone and suboxone</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that bind to the same receptors as heroin and prescription painkillers. Ibogaine and other psychedelics have shown </span><a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/treating-addiction-with-psychedelics/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">effectiveness in treating addictions</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, although people usually have to seek such treatments underground due to the drug’s legal status, and those trying to quit using opioids may need MAT as well to ease withdrawal symptoms. Harm reduction is an invaluable tool for combatting the opioid crisis. The basic principle of harm reduction is that while we cannot eradicate drug use, we can reduce the harm associated with consuming drugs. Examples of harm reduction as it relates to opioid use include </span><a href="http://harmreductionactioncenter.org/HRAC_DOCUMENTS/SYRINGE%20ACCESS/CDC%20endorsement%20of%20SAP.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;">syringe exchanges</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="http://harmreduction.org/issues/overdose-prevention/overview/overdose-basics/understanding-naloxone/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">access to naloxone</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and </span><a href="http://www.drugpolicy.org/sites/default/files/DPA_Fact%20sheet_Supervised%20Consumption%20Services_2017.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;">safe consumption/injection facilities (SIF/SCFs</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">). Unfortunately, these options can be very difficult to access due to prohibition. </span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Many of the risks associated with opioid use are the result of prohibition. Due to fear of both punishment and the social stigma that comes with using drugs, prohibition drives people to consume alone and in more dangerous environments, to share needles, and to not seek help. Because of prohibition, young people are only taught to not to use drugs and are not given the necessary information on how to reduce risks should one decide to take drugs. Harm reduction resources like SIFs are largely unavailable under prohibition because they provide a space for people to consume illegal substances. Solving the opioid crisis involves considering alternatives to prohibition. </span>

&#8212;&#8211;

<b>THE IGNORED EXPERIENCES OF CHRONIC PAIN PATIENTS</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">It is vital to consider the lived experiences of people who use opioids when discussing how to solve the opioid crisis &#8212; from people who struggle with problematic non-medical use to those who need prescription opioids for a decent quality of life. Neglecting the voices of people who take and have personal experience using opioids makes the problem more difficult to solve.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">People who live with severe and chronic pain are often left out of the discussion and mischaracterized by those who speak over them. Without daily opioid treatment, many people with disabilities and chronic pain are unable to live comfortably. It is all too common to hear people who have no experience with chronic pain negatively discussing someone with severe and chronic pain’s dependency on opioids, and faulting doctors for prescribing the medication. Much of this attitude comes from conflating “addiction” and “dependence” as well as from not understanding the types of conditions for which opioids are simply the best option. </span><a href="http://ajp.psychiatryonline.org/doi/pdfplus/10.1176/ajp.2006.163.5.764"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Physical dependence can occur without addiction</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Most people with chronic pain who use opioids are physically dependent; they require opioids to manage pain and prevent withdrawal. However, as long as they take their medication, they do not experience the loss of control and compulsive behaviors that are associated with substance use disorder. And yes, doctors who prescribe these medications know that their patients will become dependent on them. Long-term opioid treatment is simply the best option for many people dealing with severe chronic pain, especially for conditions that have no known cure. </span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Because of the harsh backlash against prescription painkillers, many doctors have been </span><a href="https://www.usnews.com/news/best-states/maine/articles/2017-04-22/chronic-pain-patients-say-opioid-law-creates-new-crisis"><span style="font-weight: 400;">forced to restrict pain patients’ access to opioids</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Restricting medications for people who depend on opioids for a decent quality of life is horribly inhumane. Also, these restrictions drive those who are using prescription opioids non-medically to seek riskier alternatives, putting them in danger of ingesting counterfeit pills or adulterated heroin. </span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">It is time to stop pinning pain patients and people who struggle with opioid use against each other. Limiting prescriptions to combat substance use disorder hurts people with chronic and severe pain, and it does not solve the problem of substance use disorder. Likewise, demonizing those who struggle with opioid use disorder in contrast to those who take opioids as prescribed only harms those who struggle with their use. Decisionmakers and drug policy reform activists need to consider the perspectives and experiences of those most affected in order to successfully combat the opioid crisis. So many of us have been personally affected by overdose and addiction, and the discussions around this topic are highly emotional, but we must be careful not to react with backlash that does more harm than good. Additionally, we must continue fighting to end the War on Drugs that has created this problem.</span>
