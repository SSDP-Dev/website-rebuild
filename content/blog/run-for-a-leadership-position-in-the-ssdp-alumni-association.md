<span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s election season everywhere, even at the <a href="http://ssdp.org/alumni">SSDP Alumni Association</a>. It’s been a year since the inception of the Association, which means it’s time to have our very first <a href="http://ssdp.org/alumni/leadership/">Leadership Board</a> elections. The first </span><a href="http://ssdp.org/alumni/leadership/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Leadership Board members</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> were appointed by staff and other Board members. But their one-year terms are expiring, and they need to be re-elected or replaced. Here’s our election schedule:</span>
<ul>
	<li><a href="https://docs.google.com/a/ssdp.org/forms/d/1Xk2w8ECPIaAYH5WCDP1HBW7YYw72ZuLKOm3bwXcYP6Q/edit?usp=sharing"><b>Nominations Open</b></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Today!</span></li>
	<li><b>Nominations Close</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Friday, February 19</span></li>
	<li><b>Candidate Statements Available Online</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Monday, March 7</span></li>
	<li><b>Deadline for Voting Eligibility:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">* Friday, March 18</span></li>
	<li><b>Voting Opens</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Monday, March 21</span></li>
	<li><b>Voting Closes</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Friday, April 1</span></li>
</ul>
<i><span style="font-weight: 400;">*Only <a href="http://ssdp.org/alumni/members">Association members</a> in good standing may vote</span></i>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">This will allow us to announce results before </span><a href="http://ssdp.org/events/ssdp2016/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">the conference</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, so the new Leadership Board members will have an opportunity to network with their fellow Board members and Association members while there. This also means the 30-day transitional period between Board members occurs during the conference, giving new members an unique opportunity to consult with their predecessors in person. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">To run, nominees need only meet these simple qualifications:</span>
<ul>
	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Be a member of the Association in good standing*</span></li>
	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://docs.google.com/a/ssdp.org/forms/d/1Xk2w8ECPIaAYH5WCDP1HBW7YYw72ZuLKOm3bwXcYP6Q/edit?usp=sharing"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Be nominated</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by February 19</span></li>
</ul>
<i><span style="font-weight: 400;">*Students may join the Association the semester they plan to graduate for the purpose of running for the Board</span></i>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Each region is represented by three members on the Leadership Board. You may only vote for Board members in your region. Each region has these seats to fill: President, Vice President, and Secretary, with these responsibilities:</span>
<h2><b>President (1-10 hours/week)</b></h2>
<ul>
	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Proactively facilitate communication within Leadership Board</span></li>
	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Develop, implement plans for achieving goals for regional Alumni Network</span></li>
	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Keep regional Association informed</span></li>
</ul>
<h2><b>Vice President (1-5 hours/week)</b></h2>
<ul>
	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Assist President as needed</span></li>
</ul>
<h2><b>Secretary (1-5 hours/week)</b></h2>
<ul>
	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Keep track of important dates and events </span></li>
	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Assist President and Vice President as needed</span></li>
	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Record meeting minutes (and file in appropriate Google Drive documents/folders)</span></li>
</ul>
&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">All Leadership Board members are expected to expand the Association’s numbers and contribute to ongoing conversations on improving the Association and developing and implementing programs.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’re interested in running but have questions about what it’s like, ask the </span><a href="http://ssdp.org/alumni/leadership/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">current Leadership Board</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. They know best. (Speaking for myself, I’m happy to </span><a href="mailto:a.kathryn.parker@alumni.ssdp.org"><span style="font-weight: 400;">answer any questions</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> you may have.)</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">For me, personally, serving on the Leadership Board has been one of the most rewarding experiences as an SSDPer. I have loved the opportunity to connect my fellow alumni to the SSDP network, without which my life would be unrecognizable. I hope you’ll consider running for the Leadership Board for your region. We can’t make it happen without great people like you!</span>
