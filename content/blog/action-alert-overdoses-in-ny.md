Here in New York, we&#8217;ve been hard at work trying to pass an <a href="http://ssdp.org/campaigns/good-samaritan-policies">Good Samaritan</a> (or Medical Amnesty) bill that would protect individuals from criminal prosecution when calling 911 in an alcohol or other drug related medical emergency. This life-saving overdose prevention bill passed through the State Assembly last week and now we only have a few days left of the legislative year to get it through the Senate.



It is crucial that we flood Senator Skelos&#8217;s office with calls urging his support in the next 24 hours to make sure this life-saving bill becomes a live-saving law next week!



<strong>Call Senator Dean Skelos, the New York Senate Majority Leader, at <a href="tel:%28518%29%20455-3171">(518) 455-3171</a> and urge him to consider the following:</strong>



&#8211; <a href="http://open.nysenate.gov/legislation/api/1.0/lrs-print/bill/S4454A-2011">S4454A</a> has been carefully crafted to save lives while not allowing drug dealers to &#8220;walk free&#8221;



&#8211; The Assembly version of this bill will save lives and should pass without amendments



&#8211; Senators on both sides of the aisle have already expressed their support for the bill as currently written and no amendments are necessary for it&#8217;s passage



<a href="http://ssdp.org/campaigns/good-samaritan-policies/nymap">Your supportive calls last week</a> on this issue caused Senate Majority Leader Skelos to take notice! It&#8217;s looking likely that this bill will pass, but now some are calling for amendments to weaken the bill and <strong>we need to make our voices heard.</strong>



After you call his office, we&#8217;d love to hear how it went, so let us know <a href="https://spreadsheets2.google.com/spreadsheet/viewform?formkey=dGc3VF9DdXkxaDNaMkU5QTNSUWd3UlE6MQ">here</a>. If you don&#8217;t live or go to school in New York, than please pass this around to friends! We&#8217;ve got to act now and we can&#8217;t do it without your help.
