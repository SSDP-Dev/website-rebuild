<em></em>These stencilled graffiti appeared on a corner I pass to go to work, Cuauhtemoc and Morelos in the Delegacion Coyoacan. It&#8217;s a well-traveled corner, in between a vibrant market and a main thoroughfare. A school sits a couple of blocks away. Coyoacan is one of the oldest, most established, and wealthy places in Mexico City. It&#8217;s a favorite place for a Sunday afternoon stroll. The ice creams are delicious.



The stencil on the left, with a person pointing a gun at somebody&#8217;s head, with the word, Calderonismo, underneath it, suggests that the President has not offered the country anything but violence. Whether that&#8217;s true or not is obviously up for debate. But Mexico is certainly beset with little but a concern for violence, much of it from the drug war, and for which some people obviously blame President Calderon.



<em>&#8220;Ni uno mas &#8212; Crucifix &#8212; Ni uno mas.&#8221; (Not one more.)</em>

&nbsp;



Since 2006, when President Felipe Calderon entered office in Mexico, 35,000 people have died. And an unkown number have disappeared without trace. The cross is a symbol to commemorate the dead, and the words &#8220;Not one more&#8221; coupled with the reference to Calderon in the previous graffiti implicitly reject the chilling statisic of 35,000 dead.
