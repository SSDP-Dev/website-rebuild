<b>Support. Don’t Punish.</b> is a global advocacy campaign calling for better drug policies that prioritize public health and human rights. And when we say global, we mean global; in 2014, over 100 cities in 41 different countries participated in the action. This year we want to achieve even more and we already have over 60 cities who confirmed their participation.

<b>What makes this action global?</b>

All local actions around the world will be connected together by the <b>Support. Don’t Punish.</b> logo and the common message we want to send about drug policy. Apart from that, it will be your choice which specific issues you want to focus on during your local actions, as well as how you are going to spread this message. On June 10th, we will publish on our website a set of all the resources you will need to join the global <b>Support. Don’t Punish.</b> action.

<b>What is so special about June 26th?</b>

June 26th is the<a href="http://www.un.org/en/events/drugabuseday" target="_blank"> United Nations’ International Day Against Drug Abuse and Illicit Trafficking</a>. Sadly, this day has historically been used to celebrate the prohibitionist efforts of governments in the War on Drugs. But we want the voices for sensible drug policy reform to be heard, which is why June 26th is going to be an attempt by the global community to “reclaim” the message.

<div id="attachment_15835" style="width: 255px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><a href="http://ssdp.org/assets/Nadezdha-Tolokonnikova-and-Maria-Alyokhina-800x532-629x418.jpg"><img class="wp-image-15835 " src="http://ssdp.org/assets/Nadezdha-Tolokonnikova-and-Maria-Alyokhina-800x532-629x418-300x199.jpg" alt="Nadezdha-Tolokonnikova-and-Maria-Alyokhina-800x532-629x418" width="245" height="163" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">In Moscow (Russia), members of the infamous punk band “Pussy Riot” joined activists for a number of photos, which gained media attention.</p></div>

Why is this June 26th an important chance to inform as many people as possible around the world about the failings of drug war policy? Because in April 2016 we will have a unique opportunity to confront UN member states about the failed the international drug control conventions at the <a href="http://www.unodc.org/ungass2016/" target="_blank">United Nations General Assembly Special Session on the World Drug Problem.</a> Delegations of all the countries of the world will meet to discuss potential reforms of international drug policy; our idea is to advocate for an approach focused on public health and human rights, rather than criminal justice. If we make significant strides in the international arena, chances are many more will recognize the benefits of a sensible drug policy. That’s why we need all of you out there to shout out for support, not punishment.
