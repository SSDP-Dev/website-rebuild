From Niambe Tosh:

<blockquote>It was thirty-five years ago that my dad, Peter Tosh, released his groundbreaking hit, &#8220;Legalize It.&#8221;  His song became an anthem for a generation of young people who shared his mission that marijuana should be legal.  As a mom and a teacher, I see how our marijuana laws have failed this generation.  That&#8217;s why I&#8217;m proud to work with Students for Sensible Drug Policy to generate support for the upcoming marijuana legalization bill.



<strong>Please watch this video</strong><strong> to see how you can help us by making your own ad or video in support of the bill.</strong>  Here&#8217;s a hint &#8230;  You can answer this question: &#8220;What does &#8216;Legalize It&#8217; mean to me?&#8221;  You can win a free commemorative box set of the album that Sony Records has graciously agreed to offer if we use your ad. <a href="http://salsa.democracyinaction.org/dia/track.jsp?v=2&amp;c=9oH345bdw%2BAU1gh6oTbkswJT8H%2Bmau%2Bv" target="_blank">Click here to find out more about the contest rules and prizes.</a></blockquote>
