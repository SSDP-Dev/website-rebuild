We had a fantastic time at <a href="http://www.netrootsnation.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Netroots Nation 2017</a> where we presented the Chapter Activity Tracker alongside <a href="https://hustle.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hustle</a> as part of our panel on gamifying activism and building digital organizing tools that scale out.

If you want to get some insight into how we created the CAT, why we use it, and what we will be doing to make it better, you can watch the recording of our livestream <a href="https://www.facebook.com/pg/ssdp/videos/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>.

In addition to an excellent discussion about the role that digital tools and the CAT play in grassroots organizing, we were also excited to announce that we have made the CAT open source! You can now find the entire tool on our <a href="https://github.com/StudentsForSensibleDrugPolicy/Chapter-Activity-Tracker" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GitHub</a>. If you&#8217;ve got an eye for web design, check it out to see how it ticks, and feel free to contribute to making it better.

If you&#8217;ve got additional questions about our newly open-sourced CAT, you can email tyler@ssdp.org
