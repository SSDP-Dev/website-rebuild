For the past decade, we&#8217;ve hosted our conference biennially, but starting in 2016, we&#8217;re excited to announce that <strong>we&#8217;re switching to an annual Spring conference schedule!</strong> During these extraordinary three-day events, the SSDP network comes together to celebrate, learn, connect, and advocate at the SSDP Conference.

</div>
<div>Next spring, <a href="http://ssdp.org/events/ssdp2016/">SSDP2016</a> will bring more than 400 student members, alumni, and supporters to Washington, DC for our largest-ever gathering featuring:</div>
<div>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Educational programming.</strong> The core conference program will include prominent keynote speakers and panels addressing the hottest topics in policy, harm reduction, leadership, organizing, and advocacy.</li>
	<li><strong>Awards Ceremony + Dance Party.</strong> SSDP recognizes outstanding network members with an annual awards ceremony followed by a dance party.</li>
	<li><strong>Student Congress.</strong> Our annual student board member election and governing resolution process invites all SSDP members to participate in defining <em>their</em> SSDP.</li>
	<li><strong>And more.</strong> An alumni gathering, regional meetups, networking meals, and other events offer nearly non-stop opportunities to connect with advocates and leaders of the drug policy reform movement!</li>
</ul>
