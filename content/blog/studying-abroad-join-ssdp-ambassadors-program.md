You can help us build our  international student movement by introducing  SSDP at your university abroad and sharing how it has impacted your life.  Whether you are studying in Europe, Latin America, Australia, Africa or Asia, drug policy is a global issue that affects youth and students all over the world.  Help us spread the message and reform drug policy—one chapter at a time!
