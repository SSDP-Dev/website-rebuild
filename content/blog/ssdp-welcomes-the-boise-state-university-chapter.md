Hey everyone, I&#8217;m happy to announce more exciting developments for SSDP in the Mountain Region as we welcome another newly established chapter at <a href="http://ssdp.org/chapters/mountain/idaho/boise-state-university/" target="_blank">Boise State University</a>. Here&#8217;s what current chapter leader Tate Fegley had to say about their group!

<b>How did you hear about SSDP? </b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Through an IHS program &#8211; they were doing a video series on the drug war.</span>

<b>Why did you want to get involved/what made you decide to start a chapter?</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">I wanted to start the group because I&#8217;m studying criminal justice and I see that drug prohibition pervades many issues in criminal justice. I consider drug policy a major contributor to the militarization of the police, and while taking a criminal procedure class on 4th amendment, I saw through case law how our 4th amendment right has been eroded with drug policy. </span>

<b>What has the reception been like on campus? From students, teachers, administration, etc.</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">I’m happy to see how many students will come up to us and talk about how important they think it is to have an SSDP chapter on campus. Many are really glad to know Boise State has an SSDP chapter, especially those that have transferred from other campuses that also have a chapter. Many students will find us through the school’s involvement page, and that’s been really great. I would have liked to get better response from the professors. I’m in the criminal justice department, and I’d like to have found more endorsement or buy in from that department, but I&#8217;m hopeful that with some work we can get them to be more engaged. </span>

<b>What are some of the things you have planned or want to plan for next semester?</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">For this year we&#8217;ll definitely be doing some documentary screening, potentially bringing in ACLU or NORML to talk about civil rights. We&#8217;ve identified a local group that is working to get an adult-use cannabis ballot initiative off the ground, so we&#8217;ll be working with them to gather signatures and get out the vote. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">We’re also considering putting together a “free speech wall” so that people can talk about their experiences with the drug war. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span>

<b>What is the most challenging part of your experience starting/running the chapter so far? </b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Getting people to show up to meetings.</span>

<b>What is the most rewarding part?</b>

Interacting with excited students who want to join in and start working with us.
