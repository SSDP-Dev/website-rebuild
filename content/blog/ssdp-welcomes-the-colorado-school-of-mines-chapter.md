I am overjoyed to introduce the newest SSDP chapter, <a href="http://ssdp.org/chapters/mountain/colorado/colorado-school-of-mines/" target="_blank">Colorado School of Mines</a>. I reached out to chapter leaders Jake and Raina about their start with SSDP, what the chapter has done so far, and their plans for the future.

We would also like to work towards a community discussion on the state of recreational and medical dispensaries in Golden, CO.

This irrational thinking drives</span><span id="E120" class="qowt-font2-TimesNewRoman"> a lot of busi</span><span id="E121" class="qowt-font2-TimesNewRoman">ness into neighboring counties without making the slightest change in</span><span id="E122" class="qowt-font2-TimesNewRoman"> the use of cannabis in Golden.
