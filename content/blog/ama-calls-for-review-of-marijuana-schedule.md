<blockquote>&#8220;Our American Medical Association (AMA) urges that marijuana&#8217;s status as a federal Schedule I controlled substance be reviewed with the goal of facilitating the conduct of clinical research and development of cannabinoid-based medicines,&#8221; the AMA&#8217;s<a href="http://www.ama-assn.org/assets/meeting/mm/i-09-statements-recommendations.pdf">statement (PDF) reads</a>. &#8220;This should not be viewed as an endorsement of state-based medical cannabis programs, the legalization of marijuana, or that scientific evidence on the therapeutic use of cannabis meets the current standards for a prescription drug product.&#8221;</blockquote>
If for some reason you haven&#8217;t been convinced that the <a href="http://www.blogger.com/mpp.org">marijuana legalization and regulation movement</a> currently has more momentum than ever before, the above statement should be convincing enough. It signals the common sense understanding that at the very least, the scheduling of marijuana should allow for scientific research.

The last time the <a href="http://www.marijuanalibrary.org/AMA_opposes_1937.html">American Medical Association criticized the prohibition of marijuana</a> was in 1937, when the plant was made illegal through the Marijuana Tax Act. The new statement comes on the heels of a medical marijuana victory in Maine and the <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2009/11/04/breckenridge-votes-overwh_n_344815.html">legalization of marijuana for adults in Breckenridge, CO</a>. Let&#8217;s not forget the Gallup poll showing 44% of American&#8217;s support legalizing pot and the new memo from the DoJ telling the feds to back off those in compliance with state medical marijuana laws.

I don&#8217;t need any more convincing &#8211; marijuana law reform is happening. I&#8217;m in Albuquerque, NM for the <a href="http://www.blogger.com/reformconference.org">Drug Policy Alliance International Drug Policy Reform Conference</a>. Getting off the plane at ABQ, I headed down to the baggage claim to see a huge blue banner welcoming the DPA conference attendees to Albuquerque. Thanks Albuquerque.
