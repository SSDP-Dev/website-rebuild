<em><strong>by A. Kathryn Parker &#8217;06</strong></em>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">I’ve heard every excuse in the book for not </span><a href="http://ssdp.org/alumni/sign-up/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">joining the Alumni Association</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Most often, these excuses are flimsy at best. Here are the three excuses I hear too often, and why they’re wrong.</span>
<ol>
 	<li><b> “I don&#8217;t think I participated in SSDP enough as a student to be in the Alumni Association.”</b></li>
</ol>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Did you do anything with the SSDP chapter at your school? If you can answer &#8220;yes&#8221; to that question, you qualify to </span><a href="http://ssdp.org/alumni/sign-up/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">join the Alumni Association</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. It’s that easy. It doesn&#8217;t matter if you only attended one meeting or event, or if you only went to support a friend. If you participated in SSDP as a student in some way, you qualify to join the Alumni Association (as long as you are a member of the </span><a href="http://ssdp.org/sensible-society-for-students-and-alumni/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sensible Society</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">). </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">I won&#8217;t lie, when I was a student, the only reason I gave SSDP any thought is because my boyfriend was the chapter&#8217;s co-founder. I was what I&#8217;d call an SSDP girlfriend. Sure, I went to some chapter events, but I was hesitant to do much with our SSDP chapter. My involvement was solely to support my boyfriend. I was skeptical of the implications of my involvement with the chapter. I was more actively involved in Student Media, the LGBT campus group, the Student Global AIDS campaign, and the Women’s Center while in school. I honestly didn’t do much for SSDP or engage in the organization until after I’d graduated.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">So stop making excuses about how you only went to one SSDP event in school. Get involved as an alum, and it won&#8217;t matter. I was simply a supportive girlfriend attending the occasional SSDP event. I didn&#8217;t attend a conference until I was an alumna. But I realized the importance of SSDP’s work and the network the organization generates and became an alumni leader. Never has an SSDPer given me a hard time because I didn’t contribute much to my chapter while in school. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">If you attended an event as a student &#8212; even if it was just one event &#8212; and you care about the SSDP network, </span><a href="http://ssdp.org/alumni/sign-up/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">join the Alumni Association</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">! We&#8217;re looking for members like you! </span>
<ol start="2">
 	<li><b> “I don’t have the time.”</b></li>
</ol>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The amount of commitment required by the Alumni Association is quite small. It’d obviously be great if we all had the time to do everything on the </span><a href="http://ssdp.org/alumni/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">list of ways to stay engaged</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, but even I can’t do all that, and I devote a lot of time to SSDP and the Alumni Association. We know your time is precious. That’s why we make it easy to stay involved. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Simply sending an email to an elected official about policy change meets the necessary engagement requirements. So does attending any SSDP event, uploading photos to </span><a href="https://photos.google.com/share/AF1QipNiPTlN9nCuaxTPuw7dfI4M5Mc2EWuezZ1YtumciDs-wXT700gcnhEaZZ4kCXty9g?key=bEcxdXZndUswMnZ1dWN0b2VYbllQSXVvTGF5aTFR"><span style="font-weight: 400;">SSDP’s Google photo archives</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, inviting your friends to SSDP events, and recruiting just one member to the Alumni Association. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Most of those activities could be done in little to no time, and very well may be things you’re already doing. That’s not so much to do to </span><a href="http://ssdp.org/alumni/sign-up/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">be a part of the official alumni network</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, giving you access to a quarterly newsletter and exclusive discounts to SSDP events. </span>
<ol start="3">
 	<li><b> “I’m not a member of the Sensible Society.”</b></li>
</ol>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">This is the flimsiest excuse I hear because you have full power to fix this. Though I encourage you to give as much as you can, alumni can </span><a href="http://ssdp.org/sensible-society-for-students-and-alumni/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">join the Sensible Society for as little as $1 per month</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Seriously. $1. If you’re just getting on your feet after graduation and can’t afford to spare a single dollar, or if you have a special circumstance and don’t have a debit or credit card, reach out to your fellow alumni or your community members and find someone to sponsor you. If you recruit a </span><a href="http://ssdp.org/sensible-society/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">new Sensible Society membership</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> as your sponsor (and they note it in the “Why did you donate today?” field), that will satisfy the Sensible Society requirement for your Alumni Association membership. If you can’t afford a Sensible Society membership, I bet you know someone who can &#8212; and who would be happy to support both you and SSDP. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">I definitely want to stop hearing this excuse. It’s simply annoying and lazy. </span><a href="http://ssdp.org/sensible-society-for-students-and-alumni/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sign up for the Sensible Society</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="http://ssdp.org/alumni/sign-up/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">join the Alumni Association already</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span>
